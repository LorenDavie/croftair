# The Iliaka
The Iliaka was the Agent of Law, an instrument of the Illai to alter events within the universe. The Iliaka has been interpreted as a kind of middle ground between servants like Azryann, who are purely councillors, and Zyxazz, who is force at the level of a natural disaster. The intent of the Iliaka is that it could interact as a man, but summon far greater power when needed.

The Ritual of Summoning for the Iliaka comes directly from Oruzayr. It was passed via the Tarazyr, then through a Zairn scroll that eventually came to be in the possession of Avara, the founder of the Aeranar. It was discovered in the Aeranar archives by Vargos Zorn, who finally used it to summon the Iliaka.

The ritual invokes the Illai to choose a noble spirit of the dead, and create a new body using Oruzayr’s power (effectively bypassing Krynna, allowing for the creation of a much more powerful avatar).  All of this is accomplished through Oruzayr. In return, the Illai bind the resurrected person with a token of their power, making them extremely powerful within Ardruin. If successful, the Illiaka Ritual could only be cast once.

Zorn was familiar with the Illai’s ways (being of the Aeranar), and was able to cast the enchantment with the help of four other sorcerers he recruited. The Illai selected Argon Sgarethorn, a Coronese hero of the Civil War period, and for their token, they chose Illiasor.

Illiasor was the Sword of Law, and in Azhraic tradition was the sword of Gheihim in the First Realm, Ora. It was stolen by Morakal and used to slay Gheihim, the myth claimed. Later in the Third Realm, Coros, it was wielded by Mynok, the Lord of Justice, to slay Krothorl the Devil.

But in actual fact, Illiasor was Morakal. Morakal, the first Gheihimin and the Essence of Might, slew Gheihim without the benefit of any external weapon. Later, Arkrynn deduced that while the Azhrai could not defeat him directly, they could change his nature, and transformed him into the form of Illiasor.  As a weapon, Illiasor was inert, but was still the Essence of Might, and could defeat anything into which it had contact.

Ultimately, the Illiaka was an invention by Oruzayr to put into motion a set of events that would eventually relieve her of the Midori. The Illiaka led to the Arcanai, which would lead to Morgatu and Oruzayr’s self-inflicted death. The arrival of Akana and the events that followed were an unintended side effect. It is thought that the only reason the Illai armed the Iliaka with Illiasor, was because of how serious they considered the threat of Nalitaq. (Which raises the question of whether Nalitaq was also somehow encouraged by Oruzayr.)

## Sgarethorn as the Iliaka
Once resurrected as the Iliaka, Sgarethorn resembled the person he was as a mortal, but was different in several ways.

Physically, he had the strength of nine men and his swordsmanship, already legendary, was enhanced by his physical prowess. He could move faster than the eye could follow, easily defeating scores of men in seconds. Sgarethorn is considered the second greatest sword master in history, behind only Aryna Daikanai.

Sgarethorn could not be harmed by most physical means, and was highly resistant to magical attacks (in fact, magic couldn’t operate in proximity to Illiasor, making him effectively immune). Sgarethorn only had specific physical vulnerabilities related to the draconic nature of his body: dragon fire, the substance of the Theracai, and the Daisor were capable of harming him.  Little else was.

Sgarethorn bore Illiasor, the Law Sword. Illiasor was indestructible, and seemed weightless in Sgarethorn’s hands. It would cut through just about anything in its path: steel, stone, flesh and bone, and hardly be slowed at all.

No magic could operate in Illiasor’s presence. In fact, anything magical struck by Illiasor would instantly stop functioning, making magic and magical constructs particularly vulnerable to it.  This is why it was so threatening to Nalitaq.

Sgarethorn could not be permanently separated from Illiasor. Any apparent separation was merely an illusion of Ardruin, and Sgarethorn could will Illiasor to appear in his hand, regardless of where it had been removed to. In this way, it was effectively impossible to disarm Sgarethorn.

The only way to defeat Illiasor was to transform it, in the way that Arkrynn had transformed it from Morakal into its current form. Nalitaq had realized this and started to transform it within the Dark Pattern, in order to steal it from Sgarethorn, but Sgarethorn sped up the process, creating an explosion that killed Nalitaq, and created Akana.

Sgarethorn was eventually killed by a shard of the Theracai (wielded by his new bride, Alyssa Kanen), exploiting one of his few weaknesses.
