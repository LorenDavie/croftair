# Evalone
After the events of the Pentagata, the Illai (Arkrynn, Mynok and Hernessa) departed for Arakai, and the Morolai (Ardanor, Nadenda, Solrun and Umbora) remained with the Mnabra. Knowing that Sgarelos had become exceedingly dangerous, the Morolai led the Mnabra east, to the sea, and to the lands of Evalone.

Evalone was a land pressed up against a great endless sea, which they named Oruluin. It consisted of a ring of mountains containing a series of lush green valleys within. Upon reaching Evalone, the Mnabra split into two groups. The Mnabran warriors went into the mountains, which they named Aradan. From the mountain range they protected Evalone. Over many generations, they became known as the Macai.

The other group went into the valleys to farm them. They called this land Avolana, and over time their descendants became known as the Vallonae.

After reaching Evalone, Zed and Maridyn lived for many hundred years in peace before finally dying of old age, thousands and thousands of years old.

## The Morolai in Evalone 
During the Age of Evalone, the Morolai lived amongst the Macai and Vallonae. They refused to rule the humans directly, saying that they must govern themselves, however they acted as elder statesmen, providing counsel when asked. Even the wisest of humans would seek them out, as they were older and wiser than any human.

The Morolai grew into their identities over the ages in Evalone. Ardanor, the strongest of them, became master of air and storm. Patron of the Macai warriors, he became the God of Thunder. Solrun glowed with a bright warm light, becoming the God of the Sun. Nadenda and Umbora became the Goddesses of Life and Death respectively, making a cycle that would replenish and sustain the people of Evalone.

The Morolai also took human lovers from time to time, and spawned a generation of demigods, called the Demalai. Also immortal, the Demalai lived within Evalone as well. Amongst them were Braddle, the god of trade, Ariona, goddess of the hunt and of the moon, Kane, god of conflict, Igni, god of mischief, and Lavorai, the goddess of love. Many myths are spun around the interactions of the Demalai.

## Arik Therafrae
In the latter days of Evalone, a great hero arose from the Macai people.  Arik, said to be the grandson of Ardanor, gained renown as a mighty warrior and fearless defender of Evalone.

Arik defended Evalone from the mountains of Aradan, like the other Macai, but also led expeditions out into the Twilight.  On one of these adventures he came across a band of Ogaratu who had seemingly captured a strange floating crystal, larger than a man. Arik slew the Ogaratu and made off with the crystal.

To his amazement, the crystal later transformed and became an immense dragon: it was Oruzayr, the surviving Cosmic Dragon from the Second Realm, Aithera. Already rescued once by Arik’s ancestor, Zed, Oruzayr was reminded of her debt to humans once again.  She thanked Arik, and bestowed upon him a fiery amber gem, called the Tarazyr.

After that, Arik and Oruzayr were friends (Arik’s name “Therafrae” means Dragon Friend).  With Oruzayr’s aid, Evalone was well defended against the monsters of the Twilight Lands.

## The Folly of the Morolai
Nadenda had a daughter named Lavorai, and to know her was to love her.  The Goddess of Love, Lavorai was pursued by many, but never chose a single lover to be theirs alone.

The Morolai were also not immune to Lavorai’s charms.  Ardanor and Solrun both fell in love with her, and became rivals to each other for her affections.  Their rivalry turned to quarrels, and eventually to blows.

The people of Evalone hid in fear as Ardanor and Solrun fought, shaking the ground and sky.  Finally Ardanor struck Solrun so hard he was driven back to the place of the Petagata where, falling upon the gate, he bled upon it from the wound Ardanor inflicted upon him.

The blood of a Morolai upon the Pentagata caused the gate to open, and through the open gate came the Army of Unakroth.
