## Garathos

Garathos is a land founded by Scalarian Urlik loyalists after Escalar was destroyed, in a break with the other group of survivors, the Cai Onara (who went on to found Coron).

Traditionalists, Garathos was founded around a new city on the edge of a lake, called Toreannon. There the loyalists continued their ways of hunting and fishing, while the new Coronese pulled ahead of them in advancement.

During the Coronese Foundation period, several attempts were launched by the Garathosian Daibaran to conquer Coron and reunite the Scalarian people. That was brought to an end by Baric the Bold, the first Coronese Daionara unafraid to use the Dragons. After that, the Garathosians tried to avoid the Coronese. As Garathos had little the Coronese needed, they were mostly successful in this regard.

Over the course of the next 2000 years, Garathos developed into a quiet agrarian country. Officially they still considered the Coronese illegal usurpers, but the urgency to do anything about it left permanently.

Garathos is ruled by a Daibaran, in the style of Escalar. By the time of the Celestial Cycle, the Daibaran's power was curtailed by the Barans, who represented the farmers that made up the backbone of Garathos.

Garathos was annexed into Illisyn by Alyssa Kanen, and taken by Aryna Daikanai when she was marching south into Solrundria.
