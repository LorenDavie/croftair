# Sy Soreth and the Sorethian Revolution
Sy Soreth was the leader of Kadimac's Fingers, a secret order of thieves in the service of Kadimac, son of Ardanor, God of Thieves and patron of the Vallonae people. Kadimac's Fingers was a fanatical group, and disagreed with the mainstream decision by the Kyrosian government to reintegrate the Ogaratu royals following the curse that plagued Kyre's descendants.

Soreth took advantage of the chaos at the beginning of the Celestial Cycle, when the Ogaratu Royals were killed by Argon Sgarethorn and Cadro was under attack by Calgirna's zombies, to launch a popular revolution and take over the country.

Once he had claimed power, Soreth outlawed all religion except Kadimac, and drove all of the remaining Ogaratu into exile, or executed them.

Over the next few years, Kyros went through a series of internal purges. Mizradia was Soreth's ally for a time, until she decided that her half-Ogaratu status would eventually lead to her downfall.

The traditional Azhraic religious orthodoxy mounted a counter-offensive to the Fingers, and civil war broke out around 2006. Over the next few years, the country split into three: Kyros, controlled by the Fingers, Danoros, controlled by the Azhraic Orthodoxy, and Mnabros, a territory claimed by the surviving Ogaratu and their supporters.

Both Kyros and Danoros launched fleets to fight in the Battle of Saerluin during Korath Illisyn, as they were temporarily united by hatred of Nalitaq and Solrundria. Beyond that, they remained divided until the end in 2272.
