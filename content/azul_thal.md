# Azul Thal
In Korathoru, the Last Great War of Coros, the Ogaratu sided with Krothorl and fought against the forces of the Azhrai. As a result, when Coros was destroyed and Hernessa created the Nessarkha to save the mortals, no place was extended to the Ogaratu.

But the Ogaratu were crafty and cunning.  Before Marinarkh, the vault for the Marin, was sealed, a large force of Ogaratu snuck inside. They hid within Marinarkh, awake, as the Marin slept.  After the Azhrai sealed the vault, they emerged from their hiding place in the darkness.

Thousands of Marin slept in the vault, and the Ogaratu systematically slew them all in their sleep, wiping them from existence forever. Eventually the Ogaratu were alone in Marinarkh.  The physical domain of Ardruin had yet to form, so the vault was the beginning and ending of their existence.

Deep within Marinarkh the Ogaratu found the ancient secrets of the Marin, and they twisted them. Re-naming the vault Azul Thal, it became a city in darkness.  For ages it hung in the void, sustained by dark magic.

Legends whisper of Azul Thal at its height.  The dark magic performed within created many terrible and secret things in the dark, drawing power from Unakroth itself. Occasionally one of these dark experiments went terribly wrong, and most of the Ogaratu would be wiped out, only to return in numbers generations later.

The Pharaohs of Mnabra trace their lineage back to Azul Thal.  They were the overlords of the dark city originally - ancient and terrible. Factions would form, their would be civil war, and a new dynasty would reign for generations, only for the process to repeat.

Approximately 100,000 BE, the Ogaratu summoned enough of the power of the void to break the seal of Marinarkh, penetrating into Ardruin.  The physicality of the world had been established sufficiently by this point that the Ogaratu weren't immediately destroyed, but their entry into Ardruin was tens of thousands of years earlier than the Azhrai intended, and the world was not ready for mortals.

The seal broken, the Ogaratu were exposed to the madness of primordial Ardruin.  The madness infected Azul Thal, and they began the process of destroying themselves.  For a time, the Ogaratu seemed poised to completely wipe each other out.  Legend has it that they were visited by a vision of the Sisters, Amaya and Akedake, who unified them.

The foul things nurtured within the depths of Azul Thal finally took control of the city.  The Ogaratu fled into Ardruin and wandered the land alone for 50,000 years before the coming of Erudyzae and the beginning of the Elder Age.  This period is referred to as the Dark Age.
