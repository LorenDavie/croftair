# The Azhrai 
Amongst the oldest and most powerful beings in the universe, the Azhrai are all of the species *Gheihimin*, and are the creations of Gheihim, the Prime Being of Ora. They are immortal, and in Croftair act as the most powerful of the gods. The Azhrai are distinguished as those Gheihimin who refused the rule of Morakal after he slew Gheihim, and they are the only survivors of Ora. The Azhrai are all billions of years old.

The Azhrai are divided into two subgroups: the Illai, and the Morolai.

## The Illai
The three Illai are all Essentials, meaning they each represent the ultimate expression of their primary attribute within the universe. By definition nothing else can express that attribute to a greater degree.

The Illai are not concerned with the fortunes of mortals or their civilizations. They are only concerned with the overall welfare of the universe itself. When they do intervene in mortal affairs, a rare occurrence, it is in the service of a universal benefit of some sort.

The Illai dwell in the Domain of Illios, which can be seen in the sky of Aeros, but cannot be visited, other than by the servants of the Illai themselves.

### Arkrynn 

Arkrynn is the Essence of Wisdom, and the eldest of the Azhrai. He is their leader, on the rare occasions that they work as a group. All of time and space is visible to Arkrynn, and he knows the inner workings of all things.

Arkrynn has wrought two epic miracles in the universe. The first was the defeat of Morakal and the other Gheihimin during Korath Azhrai. Arkrynn knew that Morakal, the Essence of Might, was undefeatable through force, yet he managed to transform him into Illiasor, as his form was not immutable.

Secondly, Arkrynn saved the Universe after Arakai was destroyed in Korathoru. By carefully balancing the shards and forces of the universe against each other, he created Croftair, the Fourth Realm, and bound it together with his will, which is called /Krynna/.

Arkrynn is depicted as an old but vigorous man, with long white hair and a long white beard, wearing robes of white. His eyes are bright, electric blue, and his gaze pierces all that it falls upon.

### Mynok

Mynok is the Essence of Justice. He is the most physically powerful of the Azhrai, as the only one of them to stand against and ultimately defeat Krothorl the Devil.

Mynok’s judgement is infallible, and, with Hernessa, he rules the Courts of Destiny in Corboros. All beings, mortal or immortal, are said to eventually be judged by Mynok. He is said to be feared by gods as much as mortals, maybe more so.

Mynok is depicted as a young, handsome man in shining armor, but is shown unsmiling and stern. He is sometimes shown wielding Illiasor, sometimes with a silver lance. Mynok’s visage is said to cast a bright light from which nothing can hide, and it is impossible to deceive or cheat him. His eyes are steel grey.

### Hernessa

Hernessa is the Essence of Mercy. She was created as a counterpart to Mynok, by Gheihim and by the counsel of Arkrynn. Whereas by Mynok’s judgement, one gets what one deserves, it is through the grace of Hernessa that one gets what one needs.

It is through the mercy of Hernessa that the mortal races survived the end of the Old World. She is the architect of the Nessarkha, the Great Vaults that carried the mortal races from Coros to Croftair.

Hernessa is shown as a kindly yet beautiful woman with long golden hair. She is often shown surrounded by the mortals that worship her. Like the other Illai, she does not generally respond to prayer, except in times of disaster. Her eyes are golden.

## The Morolai
The Morolai are a little younger than the Illai, and are not Essentials. They act more like gods as we know them, and are known to answer prayers and interact with mortals.

After the Azhrai returned to the Universe in the Old World, it was the Morolai that led the Mnabra people to Evalone. There they lived amongst the mortals. In Evalone, it was not unusual to see the Morolai eating, drinking, speaking and interacting as mortals do. The Morolai even took mortals as lovers and spawned a race of demigods: the Demalai. Of course, unlike humans, the Morolai never aged, grew sick or died.

The Morolai have established religions dedicated to them, most predominantly in Kyros and Solrundria, which they carefully maintain.

### Ardanor

Ardanor is the lord of storm and war, and is the king of the gods (not including the Illai). When the Morolai led the Mnabra to Evalone, he spent the most time with the mountain dwelling Mnabra warriors who eventually became the Macai. The Daibarans of Escalar (the nation that preceded Coron) traces their linage back to Ardanor himself.

Ardanor favors kings, warriors and those that help themselves. His religion preaches strength and just rule. He has no time for those who need too much assistance, referring them to his sister Nadenda.

Ardanor has been foolish at times. His quarrel with his bother Solrun led to the opening of the Pentagata and the coming of Krothorl. In Croftair, Ardanor fathered a son, circumventing Krynna, only to have that son (Kadiac) turn against him and steal a large portion of his worshippers.

Ardanor is depicted as a huge man with an immense beard. Heavily armed and armored, lightning comes from his eyes. Ardanor is the ruler of the domain of Aeros within Croftair, and lives in his floating Storm Castle. His eyes are storm green.

### Nadenda

Nadenda is the goddess of life. She is friend to all living things, and is also the patron of nature and of agriculture. Of all the Azhrai, she is loved most of all by the Erudyzae people. She spent time amongst them in Oruflor, in the Old World, as well as with the Vallonae people in Evalone. All who depend on harvests pray to her.

Nadenda is also the goddess of the unborn. She is the ruler of the Domain of Eluwyn, where spirits dwell before being born as mortals in Ardruin. In Croftair, Nadenda splits her time between Eluwyn and Aeros.

Nadenda is depicted as a matronly woman, often surrounded by bounties of food, as well as animals who follow and love her. She has a Demalai daughter named Lavorai, who is the goddess of love. Her eyes are brown and fertile.

### Solrun

Solrun is the god of the sun. When the Azhrai entered the Old World, Solrun led the Mnabra to Evalone by shining while flying through the sky. Later, he decided to emulate Gheida Oru, and shone from Mount Ivrisol, the tallest mountain in Evalone. When Ardanor’s daughter Ariona (the moon) arrived, he traded places with her on a daily basis.

Solrun continued his journey in Croftair, illuminating Ardruin during the day, and Corboros during the night. He is especially worshipped in Solrundria, Kaegaanzyn, and formerly in Culwais before the rise of Adrarianism.

Solrun is depicted as a warrior in golden armor, riding his fiery steed Glaerandor. He wields a long spear, and advocates for truth and honor. His eyes are fiery.

### Umbora

Umbora is the youngest of the Azhrai. She is the goddess of death and secrets. She rules Corboros. Her thoughts are mysterious.

From the beginning, Arkrynn would tell things to Umbora that he refused to speak of to anyone else. It is possible that Umbora may be an Essence, unlike the other Morolai, but if so it is unclear what her Attribute is. In any case she has a relationship with the underlying workings of the universe that is different from all except Arkrynn.

Umbora is quiet. She has a religion, but she rarely answers prayers and refuses to advocate morality, punishing any priests that do so in her name. She takes a more active interest in dead mortals than living ones.

All mortal lives, when they die in Ardruin, find their spirits caught in Umbora’s web in Corboros. There she weaves them a body, in which they dwell until they are called to the Courts of Destiny. Many are sent back to live in the shadow city. Umbora dwells in Takh Sgarae, the Shadow Tower, in the very center of the city in Corboros.

When a spirit is caught in her web, she is in a position of power over it. She consumed the spirit of Krothorl, who had beat all of the Morolai as a living being. This level of power suggests that she may be an Essential. Some suggest that Umbora is actually the Essence of Mystery, Arkrynn’s opposite.

Umbora is depicted as a young, dark haired woman in robes of black. Her eyes are also black as night, consuming the gaze of any who look into them.
