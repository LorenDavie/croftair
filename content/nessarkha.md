# Nessarkha 
When the Third Realm, Coros, was destroyed, Arkrynn created Croftair, the Fourth Realm.  It was comprised of Seven Domains, all held together by *Krynna*, the Will of Arkrynn. Of these domains, Ardruin was chosen as the mortal realm.

In the beginning, however, Ardruin was primeval, not yet suitable for mortal life. To protect the mortals of the Third Realm, Hernessa created the *Nessarkha*, the Great Vaults, in which the mortal peoples could sleep until Ardruin was ready for them.

Deep below the floor of a great forest, *Erudarkh* was created for the Erudyzae.  Within a mighty mountain range was set *Crondarkh*, the Vault of the Crondar.  Far to the north was *Drukarkh*, for the Druka.  And finally, far below the land that would become Mnabra, and then Kyros, was *Mnabrarkh*.

Each Vault had some resemblence to a great tomb, because it was filled with thousands of sleepers.  Erudarkh was seemingly wrapped as the roots of a great tree, burrowing into the ground. The Crondarkh, buried deep inside a mountain, had huge halls and deep wells. The Drukarkh was carved into primeval ice.

Mnabrarkh was said to be built from fragments of the cities of Evalone, containing some of the artifacts of the Vallonae and Macai peoples. It is, for example, though Mnabrarkh that the Tarazyr came to the Fourth Realm, where it fell into the hands of the Pharoahs of Mnabra, later becoming the source of the Zairn Scrolls.

It is said that the Vallonae and Macai awoke at different times.  The Vallonae waking approximately 10,000 BE, and the Macai waking some 6,000 years later, in 4000 BE.  When the Macai awoke, the Ogaratu already controlled Mnabra, so they travelled north, eventually founding Escalar.  Legend is that they were led by Harek, the son of Arik Therafrae.

For the Marin, Hernessa created the Vault *Marinarkh*, below the bed of a great river.  However, the Ogaratu (for which a vault was not created) found and infiltrated Marinarkh.  Slaying all of the sleeping Marin, they transformed Marinarkh into the buried city of *Azul Thal*, a place of dark magic and evil. Thus, the Marin passed from the world, and the Ogaratu survived.

The Ogaratu did not sleep within Azul Thal, but instead remained awake for the ages prior to the return of the Children of Zed.  The madness of the world eventually seeped in to the city.  They turned on each other, eventually leading to Azul Thal's downfall, in approximately 100,000 BE.  After that small Ogaratu tribes wandered the world.

In about 8,000 BE, the Ogaratu, using dark magic again, overthrew the Vallonae civilization and founded the Empire of Mnabra.  Pushing back the Druka, they ruled the East of Ardruin.

The Ulmurians (the Weyra and the Ulchawa) did not pass through one of the Nessarkha, but instead were moved forward in time by Gheida Oru until they could walk safely within Ardruin.
