    Geography

# Regions of Coron
Coron grew out along the River Iruin, spreading both east and west from Escalar, whose ruins still stand on its banks. The River brings the power of the Theracai (the Dragon Glass), and makes the lands along its banks lush.  With the exception of the lands of Argona, straying far from the Iruin sees the lands return to their natural state - a northerly scrub.

## Cai Daion
The capital of Coron, seat of the Daionara and the Amber Throne, and the home of the Theracai itself. Cai Daion is one of the five cities built by Tchakaira during the Imperial Era, as commissioned by Adric the Conqueror. Cai Daion features the Palace Immitrea, spanning the Iruin, at the top of Kalaxxia Falls.

Within the Palace lies the Throne Room which looks out over the falls through a large crystal window. At the highest part of the room sits the Amber Throne, the seat of the Daionara.

In the center of the Throne room is a circle called the Cai Essa. It is a door in the floor which opens to reveal the Theracai, floating below in its chamber. By the will of the Daionara it may raise up into the Throne room.

Cai Daion is also unusual in that it is built directly on top of the Azyraad. The Road passes through a tunnel that lies below the city. It is fortified to prevent any incoming attackers from being able to access the city.

Many of the Coronese institutions are headquartered in Cai Daion, including the Boric Ikoniaka, the Baranai, and the Sokikai. Nobles of various stature and their retinue are housed within the city.

## Cai Argona
To the south, lying between the Overlord’s lands around Cai Daion and the border with Impatchia, lies Argona, and its capitol, Cai Argona. Seat of the Baran and his army which defends Coron from the south.

Besides House Argona, Cai Argona is also the home of the Sokikai, and elite order of warriors founded by Argon Sgarethorn, as well as Soki, the College of Magic.

Argona is one of the richest and most bountiful of the Coronese regions. It is well known for Argonic, the whiskey that is made there.

## Cai Theran 
High up in the mountains of the peninsula, lies the fortress of Cai Theran, home of the Theranar: The Dragonlords. Only one small treacherous road climbs Mount Azyrakh. Instead most supplies are brought in and out by dragon.

The road that winds up Mount Azyrakh opens into a grassy plateau where the village occupied by the Theranar’s retinue lies. In the center of the village lies a tower called Takh Aitha. Within the tower lies the Monitor Gem, which forecasts threats to Coron.

Also within the tower is a massive spiral stair that winds downwards, into the mountain. Within lie the Halls of the Theranar. From the Halls extend the chambers of the seven Theranar. The chambers, in turn, open into one central cave, where the dragons live.

A great vertical opening, a veritable chimney, provides an egress for the dragons to fly out as they wish. On regularly occasions the Theranar will ride out, the wings of their dragons sounding like thunder on the air.

## The Ruins of Escalar
Far up the River Iruin lie the ruins of Escalar. Once a great walled city during the Empire Age, Escalar was founded by Anaroth, defended by Erekeke and was the birthplace of Edric’s parents Edaryn and Azura.  A few years before the founding of Coron, Escalar was destroyed by the power of Zyxazz, a servant of Mynok - a terrible spirit of vengeance.

In the ages of the Coronese Empire, Escalar lies abandoned. Any that try to live there grow sick, as it remains cursed by Zyxazz. Magic doesn’t work properly near its borders.

The destruction of Escalar remains the main grievance of the founders of Garathos against the Coronese.  Although relations warmed over the ages, Edric’s original sin has never been forgotten.

## Lake Khaled
The far western border of Coron is the shore of Lake Khaled.  Beyond, on the lake’s western shores, lies Toreannon, the capitol of Garathos.  Although mostly peaceful in the later years of the Coronese Empire, Lake Khaled ran red with blood during the Foundation Period, until the Garathosi were firmly defeated by Baric the Bold.

## Azryann’s Maze
Far to the north, on the icy shores of the Sea Krothluin, lies the Maze of Azryann.  Not built by any human, the Maze was discovered by Azura of Escalar when she went out into the wastes to die.  She was instead brought to the Maze by Azryann, the Herald of Arkrynn.  It was at the Maze that Edric, the first Dionara, was born.

Although the general location of the Maze is known, it is extremely difficult to reach, even in the later eras.  Thus the Maze generally lies empty.  It remains a source of great power, and it is believe that Nalitaq visited it at times.

Notably, in the later Celestial Era, Aryna Daikanai spent several years at the Maze.
