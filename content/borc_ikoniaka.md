# Boric Ikoniaka 
The Boric Ikoniaka, or the Colleges of High Sorcery, were founded by the apprentices of Zairn shortly after the start of the Coronese Empire. Building on the foundational work done by Zairn, and based on the original Zairn Scrolls, the Colleges effectively developed Coronese sorcery into a full practice.

The Colleges mimicked the Rings of Aithera, with the first two Colleges, Pvarai and Soki, representing the Cosmic Dragons Arathazyr and Oruzayr. The Royal ring held the next four, and at one point there was a full Third Noble Ring of 16 Colleges, during the height of the Imperial Era. By the Celestial Era, only five Colleges remained, and they had increasingly been supplanted by the Aeranar and the Sarro schools.

The Colleges all sought to tap directly into the power of the Theracai, knowing that the power over the Dragons, and much magic came from there. For a time there was a category of ritual-based magic that drew power directly from the Dragon Glass, but it was extremely difficult to achieve, and therefore not overly practical. It is believed that Nalitaq had solved the problems with ritualized magic and the Theracai, and that it was on this solution that he built the Dark Pattern.

## Pvarai
One of the two founding Colleges, Pvarai was founded by Zairn disciple Mharnan Kaezyn. Legend has that Mharnan harbored resentment for Edric’s slaying of Zairn during the Edricara. Nonetheless, Edric was the Dionara, and Mharnan swore fealty to him.

Pvarai has supplied more Imperial Chancellors than any other College. Called the Power Word college, Pvarai emphasizes study of Borica, the High Coronese language, derived from the Aitheraka language, and its applications.

Pvarai’s reputation was somewhat tarnished because one of their Chancellors was Nalitaq Thanakroth.

## Soki 
The other founding College, Soki was created by Zairn’s other student, Zyryza Anadar. Cooler headed than Mharnan, Zyryza chose to not judge the Edricara,  as she decided it was not for mortals to understand.

Soki, the “star” College, focusses on comprehensive energy systems of magic over the linguistic analysis of Pvarai. Their spells have been built on sophisticated models rendered with a comparatively limited Borica lexicon.

Soki has long been in a competitive race with its rival Pvarai, with the two swapping first and second place for magical power throughout Coronese history. Soki has created the second most number of Imperial Chancellors, behind only Pvarai.

Soki has a long association with House Argona. During the Civil War, Pvarai and Soki found themselves in opposite sides.
