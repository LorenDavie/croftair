# Domains of Croftair 
Croftair, the Fourth Realm, is divided into seven discrete domains and bound together by Krynna, the will of Arkryn.

![Domains of Croftair](images/domains-of-croftair.png){: class="img-fluid" }

*Ilios* is the domain of the Illai: Arkrynn, Mynok and Hernessa.  Only they and their servants dwell within.

*Aeros* is the domain of the gods and the heroic dead. It is ruled by Ardanor, greatest of the Morolai. Within dwell the Morolai, the Demalai and the Gamalai.

*Eluwyn* is the domain of the unborn.  Mortal life originates in Eluwyn.  It is ruled by Nadenda.

*Ardruin* is the mortal domain, a physical place where mortals live out their lives. The great powers cannot directly enter Ardruin, by the law of Krynna.

*Azyros* is the spirit domain, the realm of fire.  Within dwell the Aitheraka, the dragons, and many other formless spirits.

*Corboros* is the domain of the dead, where mortal life ends.  It is ruled by Umbora, and is home to the Courts of Destiny.

*Thorla* is the damned domain, ruled by the fallen army of Krothorl, evil spawn of Unakroth, the abyss.

Between the domains are the Great Paths, connecting them together:

The *Death Road* passes souls from Ardruin to Corboros.  Likewise the Birth Road passes souls from Eluwyn to Ardruin.

The *Pit* passes the damned from Corboros to Thorla.

The *Shadow Road* climbs slowly from Corboros to Azyros.

There are many secret ways from Ardruin to Azyros and back, including through the Azyraad, the great roads.

The *Bridge of Light* passes from Azyros to Eluwyn.

The *Ascension* is a rainbow that climbs from Corboros directly to Aeros.

*Nadenda’s Stairs* descend from Aeros to Eluwyn.

There is no path in or out of Ilios.  Only by Arkryn’s will alone can passage be made. Ilios can be seen from Aeros, but not reached.
