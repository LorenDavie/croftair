# Major Languages of Croftair

### Onaran

The main modern language of Coron. Onaran is also the language of scholars and magic. Onaran is descended from Scalarian, the old language of Escalar. It has some cross pollination with Vallonese.

### Braelian

The common tongue of the west, Braelian is a mix of Onaran, Vallonese and Mahti. It is the most common language outside of Coron. Its written form was standardized by the Temple of Braddle, to promote trade amongst the Coronese colonies. It was widely spread by the Talisor.

### Vallonese

Modern Vallonese is actually derived from Old Vallonese and Onaran, possibly with a couple of Azula words that slipped in from the Pharoahs. While most Vallonae speak Braelian, Vallonese is spoken amongst their own kind.

### Azula

The language of the Ogaratu. Azula is not heard outside of secret Ogaratu communications (all Ogaratu speak Braelian and other languages). Although Azula is effectively a dead language, it has still evolved substantially from its use in Azul Thal, from where it is named. Ogaratu will not speak or teach it to outsiders.

### Mahti

The main language of Adraria, Sirania and other trade routes in Culwais. Mahti is said to be named after the Mahta, the merchant caste of Adraria. There are many different Mahti dialects found in Culwais.

### Borica (High Coronese)

Not really related to Onaran at all, but instead derived from the Aitheraka language. Borica (named for the Boric Ikoniaka, the Colleges of Magic) is the language of spellcasting, using by sorcerers. It is not easy to speak for humans: it is based on sixteen base sounds that must be accompanied by visualizations. Not all of the sounds can be made by humans. More complicated structures are difficult for humans to master, etc.

### Charrese

Spoken by the UlCharre from the East. Of westerners, only Zaraphon is known to have picked up some Charrese.
