# Waters of Croftair

When Arathazyr destroyed the Second Realm, he broke the Cosmic Flame *Aithera* into five lesser forces, the primal elements of Coros, the Third Realm. Like gods in power, but primal and primitive, these five forces, the *Arapentalai*, comprised the substance of Coros.

The five Arapentalai were **Aratolazyr** (Fire), **Aeranal** (Air), **Aradalon** (Earth), **Aruna** (Void) and lastly, **Araluin** (Water), also known as Madune.

Initially the Arapentalai raged, out of control, a swirling chaos broken only by Arakai's peak. But then Gheida Oru appeared atop Arakai, and the storms receded. The Golden Weaver's light brought order to the universe.

Later, when the Azhrai re-entered the universe, they brought the Arapentalai under their control. By the time of Evalone, the Arapentalai had become the servants of the Morolai.

Araluin formed the unending ocean from which Mount Arakai protruded, and when it receded formed all the waters of Coros. When Arakai was destroyed and Arkrynn forged Croftair, the Fourth Realm, from the shards of Coros, it included the waters descended from Araluin.
