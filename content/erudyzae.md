# The Erudyzae

The Erudyzae are the oldest surviving humanoid race in Croftair. Only preceded by the Marin, they existed long before humans in Coros, and then woke long before them in Croftair.

## The Erudyzae in Coros

### The Beginning
The Erudyzae are the offspring of Zed, the All-Father, and Adrene, the Forest-Wife. Long before the coming of the Oruzeda, the Erudyzae left Arakai, led by Adrene. She took them to a great forest that grew at the foot of Arakai, which they called Oruflor.

For ages, the Erudyzae lived in the Twilight of the Forest. The trees of the forest grew vast, to capture the slivers of light the Twilight provided them. The Erudyzae learned to depend on senses beyond sight and hearing, which is how they found the Er.

The Er is the collective unconscious of the Erudyzae people. It binds all life together, providing an empathic field between them, and their forest.

### The Coming of the Azhrai

When the Azhrai entered Coros, they met the Erudyzae people, who welcomed them openly. They worshipped Solrun’s light, Ardanor’s lifegiving rain, and even Umbora’s position in the circle of life, but they loved Nadenda most of all. They could feel her presence through the Er, and they built many shrines to her.

With the Azhrai, particularly the Morolai, in Coros, Oruflor grew mighty, becoming the greatest forest to ever exist. With great magic the Erudyzae protected their borders, and lived peacefully, isolated from the dangers of the Twilight.

### Korathoru

The Erudyzae knew that Krothorl had entered the world early on, and their spies told them of the Fall of Evalone. They met with the Morolai and the surviving Children of Mnabra, and agreed to create a unified front at Oruflor.

Krothorl attacked Oruflor with his full might.  The Battle of Oruflor was a terrible bloodbath. The Erudyzae and the Mnabra held the line against Krothorl’s army, suffering terrible losses. Finally a force of Crondar and Marin arrived, flanking Krothorl’s forces and forcing them to retreat. During this battle, Umbora learned of Krothorl’s origin as Arcun, the son of Zed, and the means to his defeat.

The Erudyzae joined the Mnabra, the Marin, the Crondar and even the Druka at the Battle of Arakai, the final cataclysmic battle of Korathoru. They battled Krothorl’s forces at the base of Arakai, and were starting to lose, when Krothorl, on the slopes of Arakai, was slain by Mynok. Arakai exploded, and most perished.

Hernessa, the Goddess of Mercy, swept up the surviving Erudyzae and put them, sleeping, into the Erudarkh, which resembled the root system of a great tree. There the Erudyzae slept for untold ages, until Croftair, the Fourth Realm, was ready for them.

## The Erudyzae in Croftair

### Adreyanne and the Elder Age

The great seal of the Erudarkh opened approximately 50,000 BE. The Erudyzae woke and entered the world. To their shock and horror, they found the smoking ruins of a dead Ogaratu empire around them. The Ogaratu had survived the end of Coros, and had woken first, long before the Erudarkh. However they had unleashed some doom upon themselves, and had destroyed their civilization before the coming of the Erudyzae. Only scattered tribes of Ogaratu roamed Croftair by the time the Erudyzae exited the Erudarkh.

The Erudyzae founded a kingdom in the great forests that covered the continent Caros, and they called it Adreyanne. Most of Caros became their domain. Adreyanne was ruled by a high council of Elders, who made the laws and guided the people. For 5,000 years, the Erudyzae were effectively alone in Croftair, and masters of their realm.

After 5,000 of solitude, the Crondarkh opened in the west and the Crondar came forth. They met with the Erudyzae and established a few lines of trade, but they mostly wished to keep to themselves.  By mutual agreement, the Crondar took the western mountains and the lands beyond, leaving the rest to the Erudyzae. Harmony continued, and the Kingdom of Adreyanne continued unbroken for almost 30,000 years.

### Druka and Darkness

Around 20,000 BE, far in the frozen north, the icy Drukarkh opened and the Druka sprang forth in numbers. Striking down into Adreyanne, Druka raiding parties stole supplies and left devastation in their wake.

Thus began a long period of protracted war between the Erudyzae and the Druka. The Erudyzae created magical barriers to keep the Druka out, but the Druka sometimes broke through and wreaked havoc. The Erudyzae even formed an alliance with the Crondar, but the power and fury of the Night People was hard to check.

Then, when they were distracted, Ogaratu sorcerers laid a curse upon the Erudyzae. A mutation was introduced, and some of the Erudyzae children started to be born misformed. Called Orkhe, or “rootlings”, the mutants were cast out of Erudyzae society.

The Orkhe formed a rebellion and struck Adreyanne from within, as it was being simultaneously attacked by the Druka. In desperation, the Erudyzae released a fire magic. Burning much of Adreyanne down, the Orkhe were wiped out, and the Druka were driven back.

Adreyanne declined after that, and the kingdom shrunk. By 10,000 BE it was a shadow of its former self, mostly reduced to the northeastern corner of Caros, in the land that would later be called Impatchia. When the Empire of Mnabra expanded in the south, the Erudyzae adopted a policy of avoidance and isolation.

### Impatchia and Coron

Later, in the Coronese Imperial Era, Adric the Conqueror took control of the Forest. Unable to directly resist the power of the Coronese Overlord, and fearful of the destructive power of his dragons, the Erudyzae acquiesced to Coronese rule.

The Coronese could never rule Impatchia completely however, because much of it remained invisible to them. The Erudyzae were patient, knowing they would outlast the humans.

Sure enough, the Coronese Civil War weakened the empire, and by 1842 the Erudyzae saw their chance. They massacred the occupying forces and regained control of Impatchia.

There was no formal relationship between Coron and Impatchia after that. Both nations entered a period of deep isolationism, so primarily avoided contact with each other.

By the 1900's, the Erudyzae could feel the growing power and threat of Nalitaq. The consciousness of this threat led them to being open when Argon Sgarethorn approached them in 2006 to gain their alliance in the Celestial War. Joining in the fight against Nalitaq, the Erudyzae played a critical role in stopping the Unkhala's invasion of Coron.

Following the Celestial War, the Erudyzae were encountered less and less by humans. It is considered unlikely that they survived the end of the Fourth Realm.
