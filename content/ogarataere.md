# Ogarataere
The chain of islands, including Marsanthia, Corsinth, Paraethia, Aesathia and Telethai, plus the Bay of Telen, were once one long land bridge that combined Caestia and Culwais into one continent.

At one time this was the center of a Dark Age Ogaratu Empire that dominated Ardruin. Called Ogarataere by Celestial Era scholars, its true name (in Azula) is a secret held by the Ogaratu.

Ogarataere underwent some cataclysm that caused it to sink. The center of the disaster is thought to be the Bay of Telen, perhaps the site of a massive explosion.

The islands are populated by Ogaratu well into the Celestial Era, however their numbers were very small by then. The dark castles that dot the landscape are thought to still harbor hidden magics of the Dark Age. The Vallonae that also populate the islands view the Ogaratu lords as vampires.
