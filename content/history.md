# Unified History of Croftair

> BE: Before Edricara, AE: After Edricara   

### Before the Formation of Adruin

*Out of time*: Hernessa creates the five Nessarkha: Marinarkh, Erudarkh, Crondarkh, Drukarkh and Mnabrarkh.  Thousands of each of the five peoples are sent to sleep, as Croftair forms around them.  The Nessarkha are designed to open at appointed times, releasing the respective peoples as the world becomes ready for them.  However, the Ogaratu infiltrate Marinarkh and are sealed in with them, awake.

*Long, long ago*: The Ogaratu slay the sleeping Marin, and make Marinarkh their own.  An underground city of evil, they name it Azul Thal.

### The Dark Age

*100,000 BE*: The Ogaratu turn on themselves, and Azul Thal is destroyed.  Breaking prematurely into Ardruin, they wander in the wilderness.  This era is referred to as the *Dark Age*. 

*100,000 - 50,000 BE*: Ogaratu empires rose and fell during this time. Great monsters roamed the land, and the Ogaratu built many cities. Little is known of this era, other than perhaps by the Ogaratu themselves. But the Ogaratu consider this period a golden age of sorts, when they were the masters of the world.

*95,000 BE*: The Ogaratu are conquered by the Faceless Ones, who build an empire on their backs. The Faceless Ones’ empire covers the Caros continent.

*92,000 BE*: The Ogaratu hero Makh unleashes the Burning Magic, destroying the Faceless Ones. The Burning Magic gets out of control and threatens to burn down the world. It is eventually halted by the future Water Wizards.

*92,000 - 84,000 BE*: Empire of the Water Wizards, masters of the seas.

*84,000 BE*: The Water Wizards are wiped out over a few weeks by an unknown threat. The Ogaratu population is decimated.

*80,000 BE*: The Ogaratu tribal chieftains join together to form the New Thal Empire. However it only lasts a few generations before infighting tears it into three: Morokho in Caros, Unxaarae in the Culwais/Caestia supercontinent and Eascerpae in Ulmuria. Collectively the three empires were called the Trion.

*75,000 BE*: Ogaratu sorcerers of Unxaarae summon Ghuruzaal, the Lord of Disaster. His presence is accompanied by a massive explosion that sinks Ogarataere, creates the Bay of Telen, and splits Culwais and Caestia into separate continents. Once again, the Ogaratu are mostly wiped out.

### The Elder Age

*50,000 BE*: The Erudarkh opens, releasing the Erudazae into Ardruin.  They found the first Great Empire, centered on the great forests that cover the Caros continent. This era is the *Elder Age*.

*45,000 BE*: Deep within the mountain ranges of the west, Crondarkh opens and the Crondar come forth.  Mining the depths of the mountains, farming on its slopes and fishing from the western sea, the Crondar secure the west.

*20,000 BE*: The Drukarkh opens far in the north and the Druka come forth from the ice.  They range freely in the frozen northern darkness - those lands are theirs. The Druka strike down from the north into the Erudyzae and Crondar empires. Relentless war drives all three Elder Empires into decline.

~20,000 BE (-14000 UR): The Children of Manora emerge from the tunnels into caves called Zhai Zhuin, somehow transported from the Third Realm to the Fourth, bypassing ages. They find the lands of Ulmuria. There is evidence that the Ogaratu once lived there, but they are long dead.

Eretei and Mheir establish the kingdom of Zhaira in the lands around Zhai Zhuin. They farm the lands and there is peace for a time.

But Gheida Unkh, taking on a fair guise, visits the court of Eretei and Mheir, and tells them of the great jeweled city of Telaza, left from the old Ogaratu empire. Mheir is intrigued, but Eretei is cautious. She finds something suspicious about their visitor.

Mheir leads an expedition to Telaza but accidentally releases an Ogaratu curse. A number of the Weyrans are infected, and become the Uzha-Ma, the Gibbering Madness. Their shape shifting power out of control, they lose all rational form. To see them is to risk madness.

Eretei must punish Mheir for his folly, and so banishes him and the other Weyra from Zhaira. They wander into the north.

Zhaira is plagued by the Uzha-Ma and Eretei prays to Gheida Oru. The Golden Weaver intervenes and changes Eretei into the first Weaver’s Daughter, or Gheidazhi. Armed with knowledge of Weaving, Eretei defeats the Uzha-Ma. She selects other women to join her as the Gheidazhi.

Gheida Unkh attempts to destroy Zhaira a second time, by introducing a poison to the Gheidazhi, in the hopes of spreading evil through their Weaving. Eretei discovers it, and contains it within her. Eretei dies, but saves Zhaira.

Mheir, learning of Eretei’s fate, takes revenge on Gheida Unkh. He cannot kill the old dragon, but impales him with the Seven Iron Rods, which prevent him from ever taking on a fair visage again.

18000 BE (-12000 UR): Zhaira is attacked by Gheida Unkh for a third time. An army of monsters marches on the capital. The Gheidazhi weave an enchantment to draw the army into the caves of Zhai Zhuin, and collapse them on top of them. The army of monsters is destroyed, but Zhaira is left in ruins.

18000-15000 BE (-12000 UR - -9000 UR): The Ulchawans wander, under constant threat from Gheida Unkh. The Gheidazhi work hard to keep their movements invisible to the Lord of Seven Rods, but he continues to plague them.

~15000 BE (-9000 UR): Approximate lifetime of Avon Vale, a great weaver and philosopher of the UlChawan people. Avon Vale led a life of many fantastic adventures, and wrote a formal interpretation of the Golden Path in Valein, the Book of the Way, considered the philosophical foundation of UlCharrean society. In the south of Ulmuria, the life of Avon Vale is considered to be the first story of UlCharre. At Vale’s urging, the Ulchawans settle in the south, in the lands that will become UlCharre.

### The Empire Age

*10,000 BE*: The Mnabrarkh opens, but only the Vallonae awaken, the Macai continue to sleep.  The Vallonae settle the lands near the entrance to Mnabrarkh, and start to farm them. This is the beginning of the *Empire Age*. They call their land Vallonos. (Later names for the land will be Mnabra, Cadria, and Kyros.)

10000 BE (-4000 UR): Weyran Weavers use their power to create the great Floating Cities of Mheira. A wandering civilization in the Great Plains of the north, Mheira drifts around, a cluster of floating cities following the herds and cultivating the land.

*8,000 BE*: The Ogaratu, who have wandered since the fall of their Dark Age empires, are united by a warlord named Pharakh Kal.  Kal leads the Ogaratu to conquer  Vallonos, enslaving the Vallonae people.  Pharakh becomes the first Pharoah of Mnabra, founding an empire that will last thousands of years.

6463 BE: In Mnabra, Pharakh Uzku leads a frenzy of human sacrifice to placate the Hellgod Marakhul. Things escalate into an attempted genocide, and Uzku is deposed, ending the Kal Dynasty.

6000 BE (0 UR): Charheiris is born. A powerful warrior and a great leader of the Ulchawans, he turns around the struggle with Gheida Unkh and goes on the offensive, driving the dark lord back into the north. Charheiris unites the Ulchawans and founds UlCharre, the Lotus Empire. Based on the teachings of Avon Vale and a partnership of the Emperor and the Gheidazhi, UlCharre becomes the superpower of Ulmuria.

6000 - 4500 BE (0 - 1500 UR): The Charheirisian Dynasty. The descendants of Charheiris rule UlCharre in what is considered a golden age. The power of the Seven Rods is checked during this time, and most threats are internal power struggles within the Empire.

4444 BE (1566 UR): Gheida Unkh releases Trarathazayr, a dragon of terrible power, to attack the children of Zhaira. First Trarathazayr ravages Mheira, and the Floating Cities fall. Most of the Weyrans are wiped out.

Trarathazayr leads a second Army of Monsters south to UlCharre and for nearly 40 years they fight an intractable war that effectively wipes out a generation of Ulchawans. Finally, the Gheidazhi overcome Gheida Unkh’s power and the Second Army is destroyed, but UlCharre is left in ruins, bringing an end to the Charheirisian Dynasty.

4443 - 3645 BE (1567 - 2365 UR): Feudal UlCharre. With no dominant Emperor, UlCharre fragments into scores of warlord states, called Tamiens (each ruled by a Tam: the warlord). It is a period of relative lawlessness, where outlaws terrorized ordinary people.

~4123 - 4045 BE (1877 - 1955 UR): Approximate lifetime of Dagada Xa, a famous outlaw warrior of UlCharre who was the champion of the downtrodden, protecting them from the Tams. Dagada was a rogue and a trickster, but also a fierce warrior with a strong sense of justice. He had many adventures, helping the common folk where he could, until he was finally tracked down and killed by the Tams.

*4,000 BE*: The Macai awaken within Mnabrarkh and emerge.  Finding the Ogaratu in control of the region, they travel north instead.  Led by Harek, they eventually settle in the north, a Macai stronghold in Druka territory.

*3800 BE*: Approximate birth of Anaroth and Keeragna in the north. Keeragna tries to take control of the Macai and become their king, but instead they rally around his brother Anaroth. Anaroth unites the Macai and builds a great city state in the north: Escalar. Anaroth becomes the first Daibaran.

3644 - 3589 BE (2366 - 2411 UR): Tam Aframi sacrifices his own family and village to the Demon Heigaza, and gains tremendous powers in exchange for his humanity. Known as the Iron Tam, he cannot be harmed by any weapon, and his touch is poison. Invincible, he builds an army and consolidates the Tamiens by force. Declaring himself the Emperor, he founds the Iron Dynasty. He is rejected by the Gheidazhi, however, and so he conscripts his own Weavers, all men to the Gheidazhi’s women. Aframi is finally cut down by Heigaza himself, who consumes Aframi’s soul. Heigaza greets each following Emperor on the eve of the ascent, bestowing the powers of the Iron Tam upon them.

3589 - 2443 BE (2411 - 3557 UR): The Iron Dynasty. UlCharre, once again unified as an Empire, is ruled by the Iron Tams. This period is marked by constant war with Mheira, and skirmishes with the Seven Rods, but also by internal upheavals and infighting. The Iron Tams rule by force and fear, they like their lieutenants to prey on each other.

During this time the Gheidazhi are not partners with the Emperor as they had been in the Charheirisian Dynasty. Sidelined, they retreated into seclusion.

*3,200 BE*: The approximate birth of Kadimac, in Hiaresseth, the capital of Mnabra. The son of a Vallonae courtesan in the Royal Ogaratu harem, and of Ardanor himself, Kadimac grows into a hero of the oppressed Vallonae people. He teaches them to better themselves despite their oppression, and steals from the Ogaratu, becoming the greatest thief ever. Eventually he is caught by the authorities and executed, but as Ardanor's son, ascends to Aeros as a Demalai.

2443 BE (3557 UR): The Demon Crisis: The last Iron Tam dies with no heir, and Heigaza is unfettered. A great number of demons break into the mortal world, led by Heigaza, and tear the Empire apart. The lieutenants of the Iron Tams are destroyed, and the demons set in on the general population.

Finally, at the desperate pleas of the people, the Gheidazhi, who had faded almost into legend, came forth and fought Heigaza’s demons. After great effort, they were banished from the mortal domain.

2442 - 2432 BE (3558 - 3568 UR): UlCharre is slowly reconstructed after the Demon Crisis. The governors of the various regions come together and ask the Gheidazhi to form a new government to rule UlCharre.

2432 BE (3568 UR): The Gheidazhi found the Lotus Dynasty. The Gheidazhi will elect an Emperor from the regional governors, and share power with them.

2320 BE: In Mnabra, the Black Council feeds a thousand souls into the Hierophant and he becomes Azhgog, the Demon Emperor. Chaos ensues.

2300 BE: In what is probably an action of Krynna, the Great Old One, the Dragon Gorgorathazayr lands in Hieresseth. Challenging Azhgog to a fight, the two monsters flatten Hieresseth. Gorgorathazayr destroys Azhgog, but the central government of Mnabra is also destroyed. Mnabra breaks into three parts: The Western, Southern and Central Empires.

1554 BE (4446 UR): The Weaver and warrior monk Mazhi Var discovers that he can manipulate the elasticity of time itself with weave. He creates Amien-Ka, becoming the first Chainwalker. The Chainwalkers become an order of warrior monks, defending the Empire.

1502 BE (4498 UR): Starting with Mazhi Var, the Chainwalkers start to form the Immortal Army. Certain Chainwalkers accelerate their passage through time, becoming like statues. They stand in the halls of Maza, below the capital of UlCharre, Chacis, looking like an army of statues. Each generation of Chainwalkers contributes to the army.

*1000 BE*: Birth of Erekeke of Escalar. Erekeke is a great heroine of the Scalarae people.

*980 - 965 BE*: Great Escalar / Druka war.  Erekeke faces off against Rakhul of the Druka.  After much struggle, the Druka are defeated and their numbers are reduced significantly by Erekeke.

*Around 500 BE*: The Empire of Mnabra is now in full decline.  The Western and Southern Empires fall.

*67 BE*: Birth of Zairn.

*~ 55-25 BE*: Zairn, a Vallonae slave, works in the Great Library of Hiaresseth.  He discovers the Zairn scrolls, and secretly studies them, learning of the power of the Tarazyr.

32 BE (5968 UR): A breathless, wounded Chainwalker from the future drops into the Lotus Court. Backwards Chainwalking is supposedly impossible, and yet he has somehow accomplished it.  Mac Xama says he is from thousands of years in the future, and reveals to the Gheidazhi what becomes known as the Xama Prophecy. After a few hours, Xama dies of his wounds.

The Xama Prophecy outlines the events of the Celestial Cycle, from an Ulmurian perspective. It tells of the GoShips that manage to navigate Crofluin and reach the west, of the coming of the Wanderer, the rise of a hybrid weaving and, eventually the arrival of Kharakh. The Immortal army will be required during this time. Also, to survive, the Gheidazhi must find a tunnel to the Fifth Realm.

*31 BE*: Azura, daughter of Urlik, the Daibaran of Escalar, walks into the wastes to freeze to death after her lover dies.  Instead she is met by Azryann, the Herald of Arkryn, and is told of the future.

*30 BE*: Birth of Edric.  For 10 years, Azura raises Edric in secret at the Maze of Azryann.

*25 BE*: Zairn steals the Zairn Scrolls from the Great Library of Hiareseth.  Containing the elements of the Tarazyr (though incomplete) they become the foundation of magic.

*25-5 BE*: Zairn, in hiding from the authorities, slowly masters the powers of the stolen scrolls. He realizes they allow him to mimic the legendary powers of the dragons, controlling the fabric of reality itself. He defines the foundations of what becomes *Ikoniaka*, Coronese sorcery, and records in his book, *Dora Ikoniaka*.

*5 BE*: Fleeing the Empire of Mnabra, Zairn travels north to Escalar. There he meets Edric and the Cai Onara. The Cai Onara take him in, and in return he starts to teach them his power.

*2 BE*: Urlik slays his daughter Azura, Edric's mother.  With Zairn's help, Edric summons Zyxazz, a weapon of Mynok, which destroys Escalar in punishment.  War between the Cai Onara and the Urlik loyalists erupts.

### Empire of Coron

*0 AE*: Zairn discovers the thing that he originally went north for, a magical place of immense power. (He doesn't realize it, but it is the entrance to Azul Thal.) Zairn believes he can summon and bind Oruzayr, and through her gain massive power. Performing his ritual, Zairn summons Oruzayr in her crystalline state, as the Theracai, or the Dragon Glass.  Before he can attune himself to it, he is slain by Edric, who takes his place.  With great power from the Theracai, Edric becomes the Daionara, and founds the Empire of Coron. This is the end of the Empire Age and the beginning of Coronese Imperial history.

This event is called the *Edricara*, and is subject to different interpretations. The simplest interpretation, held by most non-Coronese, is that Edric wanted power, and so slew Zairn to ensure that he was ascendant. However, the official explanation of Azuraka (the Coronese religion) is that Zairn was not a true believer, and that Edric selflessly took his place to ensure that the power of the Theracai remained within the Cai Onara. There is also a theory (proposed by Nalitaq) that Zairn's death was a sacrifice, and that he had instructed Edric to slay him as part of the ritual. This theory suggests that Zairn's spirit somehow merged with Oruzayr to become the Theracai.

In Ulmuria, Gheida Unkh (who is the dragon Garathazayr) immediately feels the presence of Oruzayr in Ardruin, and wakes from his slumber. He starts to rebuild the Empire of the Iron Rods again.

Meanwhile, in Mnabra, the Governor converts to Azhrai worship and the Azhraic Mnabran Empire is born.

*~ 0-10*: The Cai Onara become the lords of Coron, with Edric's inner circle becoming the Daibarans and Theranar. Zairn's apprentices found the Boric Ikoniaka, with Pvarai and Soki being the first of the Colleges. Edric founds the Edrain, an elite order of warriors dedicated to protecting Coron.

*15*: The Temple of Azura is established. Formalizing the teachings of Edric's mother, Azuraka stresses Coron's brand of honor: Daionara first, then vows, then liege. Adhering to Azuraka is said to be tied to the fate of the universe.

*23*: Edric is killed in an apparent accident by one of the Dragons. Later some speculate that it is revenge for binding Oruzayr.

*10-300*: The early Foundation period is marked by constant skirmishes between Coron and its neighbors: the Druka to the north, the Erudyzae to the south, and the Urlik loyalists of Garathos to the west. Coron, isolationist in nature, is hesitant to flex its true power.

~135 AE (6135 UR): The Weyrans rise again, as nomadic horse tribes in the North. They scorn the “weak” ways of the Floating City dwellers that preceded them.

*302*: Baric the Bold takes command as Coron's 12th Daionara. Less conservative than his predecessors, he makes use of both the Theranar and the Boric Ikoniaka and quelling Coron's neighbors. Coron is feared and unchallenged afterwards.

304 AE (6304 UR): The Emperor Van Azora is cursed by Gheida Unkh. His family is captured by a poisoned tree that grew in his garden. Agents of Gheida Unkh tell him that if he wishes for them to live he must deliver secrets to the dragon. Azora leaks the Xama Prophecy to Unkh, but manages to keep the Immortal Army secret. Gheida Unkh kills Azora’s family anyway. Shamed and distraught, Azora kills himself.

*420*: Coronese sorcerers unlock the secret of the Azyraad. They can leverage the Great Roads to travel long distances at great speeds. They do not take advantage of this for another 800 years.

507 AE (6507 UR): Gheida Unkh starts a new war on UlCharre. Revealing the Knights of the Seven Rods, undead warriors of great power, he finds secret ways into the Lotus Empire and strikes from within. The Chainwalkers attempt to predict the Knights’ incursions and battle them upon entry.

*776*: Birth of Adric the Conqueror.

*803*: Adric, called the Conqueror, becomes the 64th Daionara. Previously a Theranar, Adric is the one and only individual in Coronese history to be both the Daionara and the Daitheranar at the same time, and the last immortal on the Amber Throne (until the Illiaka).

*803-1471*: The Imperial Era. All under the reign of one Daionara, Adric, the Empire expanded dramatically. Impatchia, Solrundra, Rondara and Adraria were all conquered during this period.

In the conquered lands Adric built five cities, all created by the same architect and engineer: the Crondarans, Tchakaira and Valka. They built Cadro on the ruins of Hieresseth in Mnabra (renamed Cadria by the Coronese), Takhmir in Rondara, Tisakhmir in Adraria and Corvanda in the far south. Additionally Adric built Caidion, the Capitol of the Empire.

841 AE (6841 UR): Having spread the active Chainwalkers out through the empire with sporadic incursions by the Knights, Gheida Unkh strikes hard at Chacis. Great flying monsters attack the city, putting it under siege. The Knights appear, and it seems like the Chainwalkers won’t be able to get back to Chacis in time. The Gheidazhi wake some of the Immortal Army, and the Seven Rods army is defeated. But as a result, Gheida Unkh learns about the existence of the Immortal Army.

*1197*: The birth of Nalitaq Thanakroth. Originally a slave of House Carronai, Nalitaq escaped as a young man. He rode as part of a band of brigands before they were all wiped out by the Edrain. Following sorcery, he excelled at Pvarai, eventually becoming Adric's Chancellor. It was Nalitaq who took the earlier sorcerer’s research and applied it: realizing he could move an army through the Azyraad, taking those on the other side completely by surprise.

1237 AE (7237 UR): Having learned of the Xama prophecy and the Immortal Army, Gheida Unkh starts to work on bringing about the end of the world. Gheida Unkh starts to weave dark magics at Telaza, weakening the barrier between Cor and Unakroth.

*1281*: Hieresseth is reduced to rubble by Adric, ending the Empire of Mnabra. Three years later, the city of Cadro is completed. The old empire, now a Coronese province, is renamed *Cadria*.

1342 AE (7342 UR): The Weyran warlord Veyronis invades UlCharre with his army of shape changers. The Chainwalkers, having committed too many to the Immortal Army, are unable to counter this new threat. Veyronis conquers a large part of UlCharre, becoming the founder of the Changeling Dynasty.

1342 - 1528 AE (7342 - 7528 UR): The empire is divided, with some of it ruled by the Changeling Dynasty and some by the old Lotus Dynasty. There is constant civil war throughout this period.

*1464*: Birth of Argon Sgarethorn 

*1471*: Adric finally dies.  His son Arvic ascends to the Amber Throne.  Arvic is no Adric, however.  A weak willed man, he is easily manipulated by Nalitaq. Nalitaq becomes the de-facto power.

*1483*: Sgarethorn establishes the *Sokikai*. An elite order of warriors dedicated to Azuraka and the Illai, their motto is *Invirion* (infinite honor). They are modeled after the Edrain of old.

*1496-1498*: Coronese Civil War: In 1496 Nalitaq is discovered trying to establish direct control over the Theracai, bypassing the Dionara. Shortly thereafter, Arvic dies with no heir - Nalitaq’s plan to capture the Amber Throne and the Theracai for himself.  He is opposed by House Argona and the Sokikai. The Theranar would normally select the next Dionara, but they choose to refrain from doing so, because of the strange signals they are receiving from the Theracai.  Factions split, and Coron descends into civil war.

The Theracai itself seems to be neutral, and much high sorcery stops working. Nonetheless, Nalitaq’s power is unmatched.  However, the Argonian faction selects Argon Sgarethorn to lead it, and Sgarethorn’s military genius results in Nalitaq’s downfall.

Nalitaq is dishonored and exiled, however in revenge he captures Sgarethorn’s personal guard (making them the Unkhala), murders Sgarethorn’s family and tortures Sgarethorn until he is put out of his misery by the Last Edrain.  Nalitaq disappears into the outer empire.  The Theranar finally choose a neutral third party as the next Dionara.

1528 AE (7528 UR): The Gheidazi have a vision of a Weyran Emperor saving UlCharre from darkness. They acquiesce to the Changeling Dynasty. Over time, the Gheidazhi even become trusted advisers of the Weyran Emperors.

*1564*: The Aeranar (Blue Lords) are founded.  Founded by Avara, a Coronese sorcerer who objected to the imperial and militaristic use of sorcerery, which she perceived as a perversion of Azuraka. The Aeranar were founded on the principle of loyalty to the Illai, but open to practitioners from any culture.

*Around 1600*: Nalitaq starts to build the **Dark Pattern**, a magical infrastructure based on the principles of the Theracai. Through the Dark Pattern his powers increase tenfold.

*1654*: The birth of Vargos Zorn.  Zorn is a Rondaran with a natural talent for sorcery.  Joining the Aeranar at an early age, he rose rapidly through the ranks to attain the title of Magus.

*1673*: The Aeranar drive the Coronese governors out of Takhmir. Claiming the city and the island for their own, they form the free land of Rondara. The Aeranar’s main complex Staeridan, is built away from Takhmir (the city of Takh Aeran grows up around it.) Although only 19 years old, Vargos Zorn plays a pivotal role, and his actions during the Cleansing of Rondara make him a legend of the Aeranar.

1687: Within Azyros, Nalitaq build the Impossible City of Karazyr, using the power of the Dark Pattern. He steals an entire village of Uthasa peasants, and populates his new city with them.  Under his control, they become the **Talisor** (the road traders) and are given control of the Azyraad. The Talisor can provide transportation on the Azyraad, without their assistance anyone trying to use the Roads are attacked by the Unkhala. No one is aware of the connection between the Talisor and Nalitaq, and the Talisor become the center of trade in Croftair.  Nalitaq even encourages Braddle worship amongst the Talisor to complete their cover.

*1774-1808*: The life of Kazi.  Kazi is a Siranian nomad who became a prophet of Adrar. Previously the domain of Solrun worshippers, Kazi spread the Adrarian religion across the southern continent, until became dominant. Along with Azhraic and Ulmurian, Adradiansim is the third major religion of Croftair.

*1836*: Draconic Revolt: The Dionara dies in an accident and his heir, Kienne, is incapacitated by magic. Fearing another civil war-producing interregnum, the Chancellor Azrean determines that only the heir’s betrothed can release her, and goes looking for suiters. Kirian Illiafer, (actually an uthasa peasant passing himself off as nobility) is selected and releases Kienne, and becomes the Consort. A conspiracy is unmasked, and it becomes clear that the dragon Dreyathazayr is behind the attempted coup.

*1839*: Twelve great warriors and nobility receive anonymous gifts of magical swords, called the Daisor (weapon lords). The Daisor grant great power and make their wielders invincible, however they slowly fall under the influence of Nalitaq as they use them.

*1841*: Once a suitor for Kienne, Mordecai of Coron acquires one of the Daisor, and heads south for Bambavan. There he takes control of the fleet of pirates that control the islands, and becomes the Pirate King. The Daisor is a gift from Nalitaq, however, and through it the Pirate King is controlled.  Bambavian piracy particularly likes to focus on trade coming in and out of Rondara.

1876 AE (7876 UR): As per the Xama prophecy, weavers discover the Golden Wind, a force of weave that can be used to navigate wherever they want. They grow semi-intelligent ships, called GoShips, that can follow the Golden Wind.

*1898*: Formation of Solrundria: Backed by Nalitaq, the chieftain Kaz Kanen unifies the sun tribes of Solrundra under his banner, founding the Empire of Solrundria.  Building a mighty army, they expand as the Empire of Coron contracts, until Solrundria presses on the borders of Impatchia. During this time, the Kanen dynasty remains under Nalitaq’s control.

*1917*: Kyre’s Revolution: Cadria, the former Empire of Mnabra, lies under Coronese control. The Vallonae hero Kyre leads a revolution that expels the Coronese.  They rename Cadria *Kyros* in his honor.

*1956*: The Creeping Darkness: A strange series of plagues attacks Kyros. The Priestesses of Umbora say that the Goddess of Death is displeased, and that Kyre’s dynasty must re-introduce Pharoahic blood into their line to appease her. Reluctantly, the descendants of Kyre allow the old Ogaratu families to marry in, and over generations Kyros gradually becomes ruled by the Ogaratu once more. This is at the design of Nalitaq.

*1978*: The *Kazien* of Sirania threaten the Theocrats of Adraria. The Theocrats (the Adra caste) make a deal with Nalitaq to back them magically against against the Kazien. Thus they come under his control.

*1989*: Amberion Kanen becomes the Solrundrian Emperor. Working with Nalitaq’s backing, Amberion accelerates the building of Solrundria’s armies and navy. Solrundria enters a period of perpetual war against it’s neighbors.

*1995*: Although his control over the Theracai is imperfect, Nalitaq manages to exert control over the Theranar, making them increasingly lackluster and isolationist.  This ensures that Coron doesn’t act as Solrundria expands. The Daitheranar is under Nalitaq's influence subconsciously.

1995 AE (7995 UR): Birth of the Empress Azha Szal. Ascending to the Jade Throne as a child, Azha proves wise beyond her years. Although a Weyra and not Gheidazhi, she is trained by them and knows the ways of Weaving.

*1996*: Solrundria annexes Adraria.  There is no battle, as the Theocrats welcome the Solrundrian armies into Tisakhmir.

*1998*: Zorn, in a flash of insight, realizes that it is Nalitaq's hand in almost every geopolitical event in the former Outer Empire of Coron. He suspects the existence of the Dark Pattern. He starts searching for a way to counteract it.

*1999*: Amberion Kanen, at the instructions of Nalitaq, orders the invasion of Takhmir. This is the penultimate move before attacking Coron itself and capturing the Theracai. At the end of 1999 the Solrundrian Armada sails for Takhmir, led by A'axxon the Slayer and covered by Nalitaq's magical storm.

### The Celestial Cycle

#### The Book of Sgarethorn

The Sokikai travel to Mnabros where they learn that the physical books were destroyed long ago, but that their contents were transferred to Oruzayr, the Cosmic Dragon. Because Oruzayr is the Arcanai Pool, that means the secrets of the Midori are within reach of the Arcanai. They seek out Calgirna, who is nearby, but before they can reach her, the witch is consumed by Morgatu.

The Sokikai seek out Mizradia in Caidion, the capital of Coron. Mizradia provides them a way to find Zaraphon, who controls most of the Arcanai Pool, since he is the Daiarcanai. Later Morgatu attacks Mizradia and consumes her.

Finding Zaraphon, it is revealed that Jhered *is* Morgatu. The Jhered personality created by Zaraphon and Mizradia to give Morgatu a human existence. Zaraphon cannot stand knowing the secrets of the Midori, so has arranged for his own annihilation by Morgatu.

The Greater Secret is the True Name of Taeraevalai, which has the power to destroy and possibly re-create the universe.
