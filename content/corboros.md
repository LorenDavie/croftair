# Corboros
The Domain of Corboros is the land of the dead. All mortals who have died are drawn to it.

When a mortal of Ardruin dies, their spirit is severed from their body. While it may become trapped as a ghost, generally it is slowly and inexorably drawn down, down through the bottom of the realm, into the Death Road. Described as a tunnel of green and purple smoke, it pulls the spirits of the dead towards Corboros.

The tunnel empties into the sky of Corboros, where it manifests as an endless silent storm. The sky is crisscrossed by the Web of Umbora, and the spirits are trapped therein. Umbora, in her giant spider form, weaves a body for the spirit, before lowering it down the side of Takh Sgarae, into the city below. Most of the new dead awake at the base of Takh Sgarae.

The tower is at the very center of a vast, sprawling city. Ages upon ages of the dead live there, and the city is a strange mix of different time zones stitched together. There is day and night, as Corboros is where Solrun is when it is night in Ardruin,  it time flows differently there than in the mortal domain, and all had a dreamlike quality to it.

The Corboros bodies are beautiful, but have a false, almost artificial quality to them. They also can break over time and need repairs. A booming industry in extending the useful life of Corboros bodies exists within the city.  Within the bodies burns the manifestation of mortal spirits in Corboros, a flame called the Horuzu.

The Horuzu of a dead mortal is a powerful source of magic, and unscrupulous residents of the city sometimes attempt to steal the Horuzu from the new dead, especially when they hang disoriented at the base of Takh Sgarae.

The new dead dwell in the city for a time, but eventually they start to hear the Call. At first it is too quiet to notice, but then it becomes impossible to ignore. Eventually it becomes compelling and cannot be resisted. It summons the mortal out of the city, following the road through the desert and up into the mountains, where the Courts of Destiny lie.

There the mortals come before the Judges. Containing a fraction of the power of the Illai, the mortals receive judgement for their mortal lives.

Some mortals ascend to Aeros as Gamalai. Their spirits burst out of their Corboros bodies, taking the form of a rainbow that ascends into the sky. Ascending spirits are seen briefly in Ardruin as rainbows.

Some spirits are released from Corboros, and at any time may take the Grey Road and pass to Azyros as spirits. There they could dwell indefinitely or follow the Bridge of Light into Eluwyn, from where they would be reborn into a new mortal life, but at the cost of their memory. Some released spirits still choose to return to the city, although they may leave at any time.

Most spirits are told they must spend some more time in the city before they are released. It is these spirits that make up the vast majority of city residents. Some stay for only a short time, some for many years. Eventually they are released and may take the Grey Road.

Some spirits are damned. They are taken to the Pit, and cast in. From there they fall into Thorla, where they are at the mercy of the Hellgods imprisoned within.

A few very, very unfortunate spirits are annihilated. They are consumed by Umbora and cease to exist.
