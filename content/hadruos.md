# The Hadrua

![Hadruos](images/hadruos.png){: class="img-fluid" }

The Hadrua people inhabit the island of Hadruos, to the west of Caros, at the edge of the Sea of Viarluin. Hadruos is sometimes called the Land of Dusk.

The Hadrua are a collection of tribes of warriors and fishermen, with each tribe centered around Longhouses. They use long rowboats (called swift boats) to journey throughout the Western Isles (Viar Serez), from Hadruos down to Xotcitla.

The Hadrua worship their Ancestor-God, Aradraan. Aradraan is thought to be a Demalai offspring of Ardanor. Aradrann governs the role of man between sea and storm, and brings fish to the Hadrua. 

Aradraan forbids the Hadrua from sailing east or west. They may only travel north or south amongst Viar Serez.

The southern main island of the Western Isles, Xotcitla, is covered with pyramids made of skulls, and is thought to be controlled by the undead. It is taboo amongst the Hadrua, however there are tales of fabulous chambers of gold there, and so adventurers occasionally set foot there (often to never be seen again). An undead volcano-demon is said to rule Xotcitla.

In the Celestial Cycle, some time before Kharakh broke through at Telaza, Aradraan finally gave the Hadrua permission to sail west into Viarluin. They did so, and disappeared into the far west. Their fate was unknown - perhaps they reached Inviros, or some other destination.

The Hadrua and Entreaa peoples are descendants of followers of Keeragna, the Macai warrior who opposed Anaroth before the founding of Escalar. Keeragna and his followers were defeated by Anaroth and driven into exile, while Anaroth went on to found Escalar.

The Keeragnan followers went west, and came to the lands of Entreaan and Hadruos.
