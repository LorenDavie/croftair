# The Entreaa

![Entreaan](images/entreaan.png){: class="img-fluid" }

The Entreaa people settled in the mountainous peninsula of southwestern Caros.  Once it was controlled by the Crondar, but had been abandoned by the time of the Keeragna migration. The Macai settled in the mountains and lived lives not unlike their ancestors in Aradan, in the old world of Coros.

The Entreaa resisted aggression from the east over the years, first driving back the Coronese, then the Solrundrians.  Their mastery of the mountainous geography of Entreaan made it extremely difficult for any would-be conquerors to beat them.  As a result, Entreaan remained independent all the way up to and during the Celestial Cycle, and effectively formed a barrier between the central powers and Viar Serez. The Wall of the West, it was sometimes called.

In many ways, the Entreaa is the best preserved example of pre-Scalarian Macai culture. They live in small villages scattered throughout the mountains, with each village ruled by a chief.  The villages in turn are part of principalities, each rule by a Baran.

Unlike Escalar or Coron, the Daibaran was a rotating position, moved from Baran to Baran on a regular basis. There was no action a sitting Daibaran could take to hold onto power once their term was up, and forceful consolidation of principalities was confounded by the mountainous geography.

The Entreaa fished near their shores, but would never venture far out - the Sea of Hadruluin was understood to belong to the Hadrua people.

The Hadrua and Entreaa peoples are descendants of followers of Keeragna, the Macai warrior who opposed Anaroth before the founding of Escalar. Keeragna and his followers were defeated by Anaroth and driven into exile, while Anaroth went on to found Escalar.

The Keeragnan followers went west, and came to the lands of Entreaan and Hadruos.
