# Immortality in Croftair 

Throughout the Celestial Cycle, and before, there are several different figures who are *immortal*. They do not age and die in any typical fashion. Immortality within Croftair is controlled by specific conditions, and has measurable impact on the culture.

## Types of Immortality 

Some beings are immortal because they exist primarily as entities of coherent magical energy. Prime examples of this are the Gheihimin, including the Azhrai, and the Aitheraka, including Oruzayr. While these beings sometimes create a physical body for themselves, it is not their true form, and the destruction of that body has no effect on the potency of their spirit. Unlike mortals, their spirits are not drawn to the Death Road, and they are beyond judgement from the Courts of Destiny.

Also in this category of essential immortals are former mortals who have passed judgment in the Courts of Destiny and ascended as Demalai or Gamalai. They dwell within Aeros. An example of this would be Kadimac, born a mortal, but ascended as a Demalai.

Most essential immortals cannot enter Ardruin, by the Law of Krynna. Even so, some have successfully created avatars (Ardanor), are exceptions (Azryann) or are stronger than Krynna (Kharakh).

Next there are the durable immortals, who can exist within Ardruin, and can only be killed through specific circumstances. These beings are magically tied to Karzakarkaroth (the end of the world) and at the point of their ascendance to immortality must align themselves with Cor or Unakroth. The bodies of these durable immortals are quite strong, but also contains a weakness of some sort. Examples of durable immortals are Argon Sgarethorn as the Illiaka, and of dragon Aitheraka in Ardruin. The Illiaka, for example, was mostly invulnerable, but could be hurt and killed by the Theracai.

Finally there is the category of "weak" immortals, where aging has stopped, and resistance to normal foibles such as minor injury and disease is very high, but they can still be killed through conventional means. These immortals are tied to Karzakarkaroth like the durables, but usually are slain or die through accidents eventually. All of the Arcanai were in this category.

Some weak immortals can raise their status to durable through intense magic, performed on a regular basis. Nalitaq, and to a lesser extent Mizradia, were both known to do this. This intensifying ritual involved consumption of mortals' souls during sexual intercourse. Nalitaq was known to consume a virgin per day. Mizradia was far less picky about virginal status, and could go as long as a month between "meals". However part of her activities in this area was to maintain an addiction she had as part of a curse on her, as part of being Nalitaq's daughter.

Immortals tied to Karzakarkaroth are referred to as *Karzaryn*.

## Impact to Culture 

Immortals are frequently very powerful and tend to dominate their environment, often becoming heads of state, or at least the power behind the throne. Because they live so long, their presence has the net effect of slowing down cultural change. A mortal in their place would eventually be replaced, and new ideas would naturally come with their replacements. But an immortal can keep old ideas alive for a very long time.

At the end of the Coronese Civil War, the Theranar decided that they would never again nominate an immortal to the Amber Throne. They felt that the position of Dionara should turn over, to prevent the rule of Azuraka from being replaced by a permanent despot. (This is part of why they were so resistant to Sgarethorn.)

Finally, Karzaryn immortals' ties to Cor or Unakroth tend to drive them towards attempting to manipulate events to advantage them in Karzakarkaroth, which they constantly feel. This creates instability, which somewhat counteracts the suppressing effect of their immortality.

## Limits to Immortality 

Despite the name, most immortals die eventually.

Most weak immortals die through violence or accident. When enough time passes, the odds of something going wrong eventually become insurmountable.

All Karzaryn must die in Karzakarkaroth. That includes all Gheihimin, all Demalai and Gamalai, and any living Karzaryn in Ardruin. Also, all residents of Corboros must fight as Umbora's Legion, and must undergo the Final Death.

Only the Cosmics have an uncertain fate. Amaya, Akedake, their mother Taeraevalai, and whoever occupies the Kharakh armor are not bound by the rules of Cor, and may outlast it. If they are truly immortal, or simply existing on a time scale beyond that of the universe, is unknown.
