# Ora: The First Realm
Ora was the First Realm of Cor. Timelines into previous realms are tenuous, but in linear reasoning, one can think of Ora as events that occurred billions of years before Croftair.

In the beginning, there was the cosmic mountain, Arakai, and in a cave on its sloped dwelt Gheihim, the Prime Being.

## Arakorath
Unakroth sought the destruction of Cor from the beginning and sent agents (the nature of which are now lost) into the universe to destroy it. Gheihim was the the Essence of Creativity, and so created the first of the Gheihimin to thwart them. In his first hour of desperation, Gheihim created Morakal, the Essence of Might.

As the Essence of Might, Morakal was by definition the most powerful being in the universe, at least as measured by brute force. Morakal met the agents of Unakroth and drove them back out of the universe.

Then, seeking counsel, Gheihim created the second Gheihimin, Arkrynn. Arkrynn was the Essence of Wisdom, and counseled Gheihim in the creation of all of the other Gheihimin. Amongst many others, this included Mynok, Hernessa, Ardanor, Nadenda, Solrun and Umbora.

In those early days, the universe was not much bigger than the mountain Arakai. At Gheihim’s bidding, the Gheihimin expanded the universe and the First Realm, making it vast.  They created the Azyraad, which were like the bones of the universe. Once the Azyraad were set, the universe was far less susceptible to being erased by Unakroth.

This initial fight against Unakroth and the expansion of Cor is called Arakorath, or the First War.

## The Realm of Ora
Physical reality in Ora was not exactly as it is known in Ardruin. The closest analog is the nature of reality in Aeros, Croftair’s heaven. There was physical reality of a sort, but it was mutable in the presence of sufficient power. So it changed and reformed according to the wishes of the Gheihimin. Only the Azyraad were immutable once created.

Ora existed for ages upon ages, in what was believed to be an eternal paradise. The Gheihimin multiplied, and were content as their creator, Gheihim, lived among them.

All except for Morakal.  The only Gheihimin not created under the counsel of Arkrynn, Morakal alone knew fear.  Based in the memories of Unakroth, Morakal became slowly consumed in the fear that Unakroth would strike back and reclaim what belonged to it, destroying Ora and all of the Gheihimin.

Morakal would travel to the edges of Ora, looking for flaws in reality that would allow for the invasion of Unakroth, or faults in the Azyraad.  Morakal peered out into the void, looking for signs of invasion. Within him fear grew and grew.

## Korath Azhrai
Finally, consumed by fear, Morakal visited Gheihim, where he still lived within his cave at Arakai. Morakal appealed to Gheihim, telling him that he was sure an invasion by Unakroth was imminent, and that Gheihim must mobilize the Gheihimin.

Gheihim refused, however. He said that the universe was protected by the Azyraad, and that the exact steps to protect Cor were being taken, as counseled by Arkrynn.

Morakal’s fear turned to rage, and in a crazed moment, he slew Gheihim.  In shock from his own actions, Morakal fled from Arakai, to the far reaches of Ora.

There Morakal beseeched the other Gheihimin. He told them that Gheihim had turned against them all, and was going to allow Cor to be destroyed. He asked the other Gheihimin to join him, to protect the universe against Unakroth.  In awe of his power, most of the Gheihimin joined Morakal.

However, seven of the Gheihimin refused: Arkrynn, Mynok, Hernessa, Ardanor, Nadenda, Solrun and Umbora.  These seven are called the Azhrai.

Although powerful, they could not overcome Morakal and the other Gheihimin, and were driven back, eventually to be cornered in Gheihim’s cave at Arakai. Within still lay Gheihim’s body, and the Orunai Armor as well.

Morakal attacked.  Arkrynn knew the Azhrai could not overcome Morakal, but instead he changed Morakal’s nature. Morkal’s essence, might, could not be altered, but his physical form could. Morakal became an inert weapon, later to be known as Illiasor (the Law Sword).

Then Arkrynn and the Azhrai released the power from Gheihim’s body as a wave of cosmic energy. They took shelter within the Orunai armor, which was blown out of the universe and into Unakroth, the void.  The cosmic energy washed over Ora, burning it and destroying the other Gheihimin. The First Realm, Ora, burned and came to an end.
