# The Universe Cor
Cor is the name of the universe. It hangs suspended in the outer void, Unakroth. The oldest accounts of Cor come from the Azhrai, however the gods were not present at the beginning, so the actual beginning of the universe is left to myth and conjecture.

The Azhraic cultures (Coron, Kyros, Solrundria etc.) believe that there was a mysterious, all-powerful cosmic god named Orunai the Guardian. Orunai was immense, and was clad in a strange purple and green armor that concealed his real visage. His origin is unknown, or he existed into the infinite past.

According to Azhraic myth, Orunai created the universe Cor, and then within it created Ora, the first realm. Finally, Orunai created his own son, who was Gheihim, and placed him within Ora. Gheihim and his creations are Orunai’s legacy.

Ulmurian culture (UlCharre, Mheira, Hazhazhu) believe in a cosmic being of infinite wisdom, enlightenment  and age, named Gheida Oru (the Golden Weaver). Gheida Oru had lived many lives in many universes. This time, he created Cor and incarnated himself as Gheihim. The actions of Gheihim in Ora were direct action by Gheida Oru himself.

Adrarian culture (Adraria, Sirania, Telentranar) believe in the omnipotent, omniscient and omni-benevolent god Adrar. Adrar created Cor and all within, including Gheihim. Gheihim was not Adrar’s son or incarnation, but rather merely the first of the Gheihimin.

Finally, there is a fourth account told to Aryna Daikanai by the Sisters, Amaya and Akedake. The Sisters do not explain anything about the creation of Cor exactly, but indicate that it was the work of themselves, their younger sister Gheihima, and their collective mother, Acora. Gheihima volunteered to enter Cor first, and was accompanied by Amaya and Akedake much later.

Here is all that is known for sure: in the beginning, there was the Universe, Cor. It hung suspended within the void Unakroth. Within Cor was the First Realm, Ora. Within Ora was the Cosmic Mountain, Arakai. In a cave on the slopes of Arakai lived Gheihim, and also in that cave was an uninhabited suit of purple and green armor. Unakroth resented the existence of all that was not itself, and sought its destruction.
