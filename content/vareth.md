## Vareth
Vareth is a mostly frozen land of plains west of Garathos. It is occupied sparsely by the nomadic Vara people (more Macai descendants). There is no central government in Vareth, although there are occasional conferences of the Vara chiefs.

Vareth is also the home of the remaining Druka tribes, who were almost extinct by the Celestial Cycle. Only a few thousand Druka remained, organized into small tribes in northern Vareth.
