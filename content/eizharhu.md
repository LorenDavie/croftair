# Eizharhu

![Eizharhu](images/eizharhu.png){: class="img-fluid" }

Eizharhu is a chain of islands to the east of UlCharre. It was settled by a group of Ulchawan refugees from Zhaira in the Elder Age after the kingdom was destroyed by the First Army of Monsters. The people became known as the Zharhuan. Eizharhu is also known as the Empire of Dawn.

Most of Eizharhu is a fishing based culture, and they are quite insular, largely cut off from the events of UlCharre. Between Eizharhu and UlCharre lies the Zhauoun Sea, which is treacherous and full of monsters. As a result, the Zharhuan have largely been left alone for their history.

Eizharhu is the home of the Kamada, fierce warriors in the service of the Daradam sea lords. The Kamada are comparable to the Amien Ka of UlCharre. Like the chainwalkers, the Kamada have powers over the flow of time. However, instead of speeding or slowing the relative passage of time like the chainwalkers, the Kamada can predict outcomes (short term precognition) and adjust the likelihood of events occurring. Thus the Kamada are extremely dangerous enemies, as strings of unlikely events occur around them, to their advantage.

Eizharhu is home to Horu, a black volcanic glass that can be worked like steel. Kamada warriors have Horu swords, which can cut through metal as if it were cloth. Horu also can defy gravity, and various floating castles made of Horu can be found throughout Eizharhu.

A strange branch of the Gheidazi, known as the Veda Urun, operates within Eizharhu. They are power brokers, controlling the ascension of Daradam lords, and regulating their power through access to Weave.

The Kamada warriors and the Veda Urun joined the Immortal Army at Telaza to battle Kharakh at the end of the Fifth Game, helping delay the Destroyer long enough for the universe to reset.
