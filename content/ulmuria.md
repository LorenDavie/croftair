# Ulmuria 

In Ardruin, east of the Dividing Sea Crofluin, lies the continent of Ulmuria. Until the Celestial Cycle, Ulmuria was completely cut off from the west, because Crofluin was considered unnavigable.

Ulmuria is populated by the descendants of the Manorans: those who, in Coros, chose to stay behind at Arakai when Zed left with the Mnabra.

## Origins

In Coros, at the base of Arakai, in the land of Aralos, the remaining humans built a great city called Manora. It was contained under a dome, and protected from the dangers of the Twilight.

The myth tells of a woman, Cheinni, who scaled Arakai to find the source of its light. The mountain somehow seemed to climb up forever, and years passed as she climbed. Eventually Cheinni came upon a tree with golden fruit, and ate of the tree.

Mysteriously Cheinni became pregnant, and gave birth to a daughter, named Ahara. Unable to continue the journey, Cheinni bade Ahara to continue the climb. More years passed as Ahara continued the climb until she eventually reached the summit of Arakai. There she met Gheida Oru, the Golden Weaver.

There she found herself mysteriously pregnant, and gave birth to a child, which was the reincarnation of Cheinni.  Ahara and Cheinni learned from Gheida Oru over many lifetimes, trading places as mother and daughter. Within them was instilled the knowledge of the Golden Path.

They returned to Manora and taught the people what they had learned. Ahara is the spiritual all-mother of the Ulchawan people, and Cheinni is the all-mother of the Weyran people, who are shapechangers. Both would continue to reincarnate throughout the ages, always as mother and daughter, sometimes Ulchawan, sometimes Weyran.

Eventually Gheida Unkh corrupted the city, and it descended into chaos. But the children of Manora escaped through a series of secret tunnels, placed by Gheida Oru, led by Eretei and Mheir, an Ulchawan girl and a Weyran boy.

The tunnels led the children out of Coros altogether and they found themselves in Croftair, in the middle of the continent of Ulmuria. In Coros, Manora was long gone by the time the Battle of Arakai took place. It is said that Gheida Unkh followed the children through the tunnels, however.

## Lands of Ulmuria 
### Hazhazhu

In the north, Hazhazhu, the Empire of the Seven Rods, extends down from the northern wastes to the borders of Eizhien desert. It is a bleak land, ruled by the diminished but still powerful Dark Weaver, and his lieutenants. 22,000 years of war against the Children of Manora have left Gheida Unkh a shadow of his former self, but the Knights of the Seven Rods still posed a major threat in the Celestial era. In the end, Gheida Unkh fell under control of the Unatar, and became their thrall.

Hazhazhu is an absolute dictatorship. Tiny villages dot the otherwise barren landscape, and most of the effort is put into their vast army. The Eizhien desert functions as a no mans land, with magical barriers set by the Weyra against incursions from the North. The capitol is Zhai-A-Taru, home of the Dark Weaver.

### Mheira

With a landscape dotted by fallen cities that once floated, Mheira, the land founded by the Weyra Mheir, is now home to horse nomads. In fact, in the Celestial era, the Szal Clan conquered UlCharre, and rules in the south.

The Weyra are natural shapeshifters, and take on the forms of wolves, dogs, hawks and horses. Since the Fall of the Cities in the Empire Age, the Weyra have distrusted settling to much in one location. Despite that some towns have arisen, most notably the functional capitol, Ereteizha. (Named after Eretei, the first Gheidazi.)

### Zhaira

In the East, beyond the central mountains, lies the former Kingdom of Zhaira, in ruins since its fall in the Elder Age. The Caves of Zhai Zhuin are still there, collapsed and sealed, supposedly by the Weaving of the early Gheidazi. To the north the Ruins of Telaza are present: arguably the most dangerous place in Ardruin.

The lands around Zhaira are largely empty, however a couple of tiny villages remain.

### The Veil of the Gheidazi 

Stretched across Ulmuria, from East to West, the Veil of the Gheidazi protects the Lotus Empire from invasion from the north. Built by the Gheidazi at the beginning of the Lotus Dynasty, it had stood for over 4000 years by the beginning of the Celestial era. It appears as a great wall made of braids of golden fabric of some sort. In places it billows like a sheet, in places it is as solid as a mountain. In fact it is made of Weave, and is one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the world.

A legion of Chainwalkers mans the Veil, always on the lookout for threats, of which there have been many.
