# Alyssa Kanen

Alyssa is a complicated figure in the Celestial Cycle. Although often acting as the main antagonist, Alyssa was neither evil nor mad, but motivated by fear, anger and survival.

She was born a girl into the highly misogynistic Solrundrian society. Although the daughter of the Emperor, she was taught that she would never hold power, but would be married off as a political act to some foreign regent. Unlike her peers, Alyssa found the thought of this abhorrent, and her intended husband detestable. Depressed she had planned to kill herself on Year Day of the year 2000.

Instead she was found by Vargos Zorn. Not knowing her relationship to the Solrundrian Emperor, he selected her to be one of the summoners of the Iliaka. Angry at her father and the Solrundrian patriarchy, she agreed.

Like all of the summoners she immediately felt the presence of the Illiaka. Alyssa experienced it as a powerful animal attraction, and simultaneous revulsion. In a way, she both loved and hated Sgarethorn as soon as he returned to life.

By the time the battle of Amberion unfolded, she had begun to regret her actions. After her father was killed by Sgarethorn and she was forced to marry him, she plotted her revenge.

The attraction stood, and she lay with Sgarethorn many times following their wedding. But afterwards the hate and revulsion would return. She managed to acquire shards of the Therakroth following its destruction and, one night after making love with Sgarethorn, she stabbed him through the heart with a shard, killing him.

Alyssa found herself pregnant with Sgarethorn's son. She truly loved her boy, who she named Kane, after the Solrundrian god of war. She was a controlling mother, however, and tried to shape her son as he grew. Kane turned out to be more than human, however, and beyond her control.

Alyssa became an Arcanai at this time. Although welcoming the power, she felt it was some sort of revenge that Sgarethorn was visiting upon her from beyond the grave. Additionally she disliked Vargos Zorn's presence in the royal court and the influence he had over her son. When the first two games of the Arcanai happened, she tried hard to take control of Kane and oust Zorn, but was outmaneuvered by the wizard and by Zaraphon.

Alyssa was said to change after Kane retreated into Akana. She became increasingly bitter and paranoid. However she was determined to preserve the legacy of her son. She began to rule Illisyn with an iron fist, in her mind, on behalf of her son.

After Zaraphon's death, Alyssa was the only surviving Arcanai, and therefore became the Daiarcanai. At last she felt she had the power she needed to ensure the legacy of Illisyn for her son, and to retrieve him from Akana.

Her plans were threatened by the birth of Aryna, the direct heir of Sgarethorn. Alyssa hated Aryna from the moment she was born, because she represented the disenfranchisement of her son and his legacy. She tried hard to kill Aryna to prevent her from ascending to the Amber Throne. When finally confronted by her son Kane himself, she was overcome with guilt and finally killed herself.
