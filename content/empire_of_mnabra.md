# The Empire of Mnabra
The Empire of Mnabra was the longest lasting civilization in Croftair, going over 9000 years from its founding to its eventual destruction at the hands of Adric the Conqueror. Effectively the final Ogaratu empire, it defined the Empire Age, which bridged the Elder Age with Coronese Imperial history.

After the opening of the Mnabrarkh in 10,000 BE, the awakened Vallonae settled the southern part of Caestia in a land they called Vallonos. They dwelt there in relative peace for 2000 years.

However, around 8000 BE, an Ogaratu warlord rose from Marsanthia, a descendent of the Lords of Trion from the Dark Age: Pharakh Kal, the first Pharaoh of Mnabra.

Kal led an army of Ogaratu north, gradually conquering, conscripting and growing his army, pushing the Vallonae up into northern Caestia. The Vallonae eventually fell to Kal’s forces, and he set up camp where the Vallonae capital was located.

At this location, the site of the Mnabrarkh, he built the city Hieresseth and founded the Empire of Mnabra. Named after the common ancestors of the Ogaratu, Vallonae and Macai peoples in the Old World, Mnabra was supposedly the unification of human civilization. Of course, it had an Ogaratu ruling class.  All emperors following Kal were referred to as /Pharaohs/ in reference to Kal.

## Kal Dynasty: 8000 BE to 6500 BE

Mnabra swept down into Culwais, following the trail of Vallonae migration from millennia before. Conquering the east and north coasts of Culwais, the Mnabrans established colonies there. Mining in the jungles of the Andoren, they excavated gold by the boatload.

Mnabra met little organized resistance. None of the Elder Age civilizations had reached Culwais, so it was unoccupied except by the Vallonae, who were not equipped to mount a defense.

Deep within Culwais, the Mnabrans rediscovered Dark Age sites and relics of the Trion. From there they brought these relics back to Hieresseth and placed them in the great Library. It is believed that included in these relics were the scrolls later stolen by Zairn. Copies of copies of the hieroglyphics cast by the light of the Tarazyr. They had been stolen from Evalone in the Old World by Ogaratu invaders, then transported through Azul Thal into Croftair. The Mnabrans were unable to decipher the inscriptions, but they knew they had secret knowledge.

### Pharakh Uzku: The Mad Pharaoh 

In 6463 BE, Pharakh Uzku led the Empire into a craze of human sacrifice. Never one to shy away from blood rituals, under Uzku a new depth of depravity was reached.

Uzku started hearing the thoughts of the Hellgod Marakhul, a lord of discord and disaster. Marakhul demanded sacrifice and worship, or he would destroy Uzku and the Empire. And so human sacrifice reached a grand scale. Slaves from Culwais, and then the Vallonae underclass were brought to the great pyramid Uzku had built for Marakhul. At the summit, their organs were cut from their still-living bodies and burned before them. Then they were beheaded, and their heads rolled down the pyramid. A great pile of human offal accumulated at the base.

Ironically while appeasing Marakhul, the door was opened for Preazha, the Hellgoddess of Disease. A great plague gripped Mnabra, and a third of the population died. Much of Hieresseth was burned to control the spread of disease. Pharakh Uzku died in feverish agony. But in his final hours, he ordered a scouring of the Vallonae, whom he believed harbored the disease.

The Ogaratu soldiers descended on the Vallonae slums and started to cut down the Vallonae. But then a great storm, sent by Ardanor to answer Vallonae prayers, swept the city and destroyed the Pyramid of Marakhul.

Finally, Szakhan Terol, the Ogaratu general who led the army, had enough. He staged a coup, wiping out the Pharoah’s family and allies, and called the army off of the attempted genocide of the Vallonae. The storms abated, and Pharakh Terol was crowned.

## Terol Dynasty: 6500 BE to 4000 BE
The Terol Dynasty marked a great westward expansion of the Empire. The lands that would later be called Bambavan, Solrundria and Kaegaanzyn were conquered during this time. Solrundria in particular had been part of Adreyanne, the great Erudyzae empire of the Elder Age, and the Mnabrans beat the remaining Erudyzae forces back. Their ancient forests already burned, the Erudyzae retreated north into Impatchia.

During this time it is also believed that attempts were made to cross Crofluin, but the ancient curse of the Water Wizards was still in effect and all the Mnabran ships were lost.

Hieresseth is thought to have reached its peak during this period. Enormous pyramids and great statues filled the sky. The Pharoah’s Palace was said to gleam with gold. Mnabra was human civilization (at least in the west - they were cut off from UlCharre), and all served its glory.

### The Awakening of the Macai

Far below the foundations of Hieresseth lie the Mnabrarkh, where 6000 years earlier the Vallonae had emerged. But unknown to all, within a hidden antechamber, the Macai continued to sleep. In approximately 4000 BE, they finally woke.

Led by Harek, the son of Arik Therafrae himself, the Macai hoard fought their way to the surface and found themselves in the midst of the Ogaratu city. The destruction of Evalone still fresh in their minds (although it had happened millions of years in the past), they started to kill every Ogaratu they could find.

The Ogaratu army closed on them with superior numbers, but the ancient Macai were unbelievably fierce. Harek was said to be the great-grandson of Ardanor himself, and his strength and power were immense. Leaving a trail of fire, mayhem and destruction, the Macai fought their way out of Hieresseth.

Hiding in a nearby forest, it is said that Harek was visited by Azryann, the Herald of Arkrynn. Azryann beseeched Harek to lead his people north. And so The Macai went north, eventually to found Escalar.

The chaos wrought by the Macai led to open revolt by the Vallonae as well. Finally, secret forces within the Mnabran government took this moment to gain control. The Black Council, a group of Ogaratu sorcerers who drew their members from the nobility, assassinated the Pharoah and assumed control of Mnabra. In a night of terror, the Black Council put down the Vallonae revolt with magic and horror.

## Reign of the Black Council: 4000 BE to 2300 BE
The Black Council claimed a lineage going back to the Trion. Their power was certainly constructed on knowledge and artifacts captured from Trion sites in Culwais during the Kal Dynasty. Ogaratu magic was powerful, but dangerous; a tradition extending back into Azul Thal, with multiple civilization-ending events associated with it.

Instead of a Pharoah, the Black Council ruled Mnabra during this period, with a Hierophant as their leader. The Council, a body of 17 Ogaratu sorcerers, represented the 17 tribes of Ogar. The workings of the council were highly secretive.

During this time, Escalar rose as a rival power in the north.  Mnabran forces in Solrundria were frequently at war with the Scalarians, and the Black Council also provided material and magical assistance to the Druka in the north, to counter the strength of Escalar.

The Black Council had an obsession with snakes, and much of the art and architecture of this time reflected that. Huge snakes, snake people and snake demons dominated the imagery from this period. It is said that the Black Council engaged in rituals in which people were partially or completely transformed into snakes as part of a vast orgy. Human sacrifice, out of fashion during the Terol Dynasty, resurged. 

### Kadimac

Around 3200 BE, a Vallonae courtesan in the Harem of the Black Council became mysteriously pregnant. It turned out that one of the eunuch guards had been possessed by the spirit of Ardanor (somehow exploiting a loophole in Krynna - Arkrynn’s law of equalization that kept the great powers out of Ardruin) and impregnated the courtesan.

Later the courtesan gave birth to a son she named Kadimac. Knowing the boy was in danger within the confines of the palace, she smuggled the child out to be raised by her Vallonae family.

Kadimac grew to be a hero and savior of the Vallonae people, teaching them to survive and even thrive under the Ogaratu yoke. Kadimac grew to be the center of a great resistance. Eventually he was caught and executed by the Black Council, impaled publicly. But before the crowd, he ascended to Aeros as a Demalai, the son of Ardanor.

After that, Kadimac was effectively a god, and his followers among the strongest and most determined of the Vallonae resistance.

### Azhgog the Demon Emperor 

After the ascension of Kadimac, the Black Council became obsessed with the idea of creating their own God Emperor. They felt that the power of such a being could reforge the halcyon days of the Terol Dynasty, and lead them to crush Escalar once and for all.

Finally, around 2320 BE, they found what they were looking for in a tome called the Utterblack, a scroll of darkest magic retrieved from the Pyramids of Zaal, an ancient Trion site in the far west.  In an obscene ritual of orgiastic snake magic, the Black Council fed the soul energy of a thousand sacrificed Vallonae into the Hierophant.

The Hierophant was transformed.  He became huge - a full 15 feet tall. A terrible dark lord, with burning eyes, a horrible visage and skin like cooling lava. He declared himself as Azhgog, the immortal emperor, set to rule Mnabra, and all of Ardruin, for eternity.

In the millennia before, no Pharaoh had ever been this evil. The Black Council was consumed by Azhgog, and then raised as undead puppets of the demon-emperor. To satiate his immense appetite, an endless supply of virgins had to be supplied to him. At times he flew throughout the realm on great webbed wings, swooping down to destroy and defoul as he pleased.

Azhgog was probably powerful enough to activate Krynna, however. He was stronger than a power could acceptably be in Ardruin.  And so the universe took steps to counter him.

Around 2300 BE, the dragon Gorgorathazayr, known as the Great Old One, paid visit to Hieresseth. Landing on top of the Great Pyramid of Terol, Gorgorathazayr openly challenged Azhgog.

The two monsters met in open combat right in the center of the city. The battle took place on many levels simultaneously, both physical and magical.  The destruction was immeasurable, and Hieresseth was flattened, with uncountable associated deaths.

In the end, the might of Gorgorathazayr was too much for Azhgog to resist.  The dragon rendered the demon into seventeen parts and burned them to ash. Azhgog was destroyed, but Hieresseth and the central government of Mnabra destroyed with it.

## The Triumvirate 2300 BE to 500 BE
The central government destroyed, Mnabra broke into three parts. The Western Empire of Solrundria, Kaegaanzyn and Bambavan, the Southern Empire of Solis, Telentranar and Ogarataere, and the Central Empire of Caestia.  To each Empire was named a Governor, and they swore to uphold peaceful trade with each other.

The Triumvirate financed a Druka war against Escalar around 980 BE, but the Druka were soundly defeated by Erekeke of Escalar. Mnabra was no match for the Scalarians after that.

In the Central Empire, Hieresseth was rebuilt, but it was a shadow of the city it had been in the past. Some of the artifacts had been preserved, and were stored in the library.

It was not long, however, before war had broken out between the three Empires. A state of permanent war led to the decline of all three Empires. By 500 BE, Mnabra was a shadow of its former self. Provinces were effectively independent, with tribal warlords acting as the true rulers.

### Fall of the Southern and Western Empires

Both outer Empires effectively collapsed around 500 BE, giving up even the pretense of being part of Mnabra. The Ogaratu presence dwindled, and in many cases they abandoned the lands altogether.  The descendants of the Vallonae took control of these lands.

Mnabra was reduced to just the Central Empire, the lands of southern Caestia. Growing increasingly isolationist, The Ogaratu kept to themselves, reliving their former glory days.

### Zairn

Around 50 BE, Zairn, a Vallonae slave working in the Library of Hieresseth discovered copies of the scrolls that had been brought back as Trion relics during the Kal Dynasty. The material on the scrolls had been copied, and recopied, but never understood.

Zairn recognized the symbols as expressions of draconian language, and started to experiment with them in secret. To his amazement, Zairn discovered that magic, and the physical world, reacted to visualized and verbal symbols from the scrolls. Over the next few decades, Zairn discovered the fundamentals of what would become Ikoniaka: Coronese Sorcery.

In 30 BE, Zairn, stealing several of the scrolls, escaped Mnabra and stole north to Escalar. There he would meet the Cai Onara, and be part of the founding of Coron.

## Azhraic Mnabra: 0 AE to 1281 AE
Around the time of the Edricara, the Governor of Mnabra converted to Azhrai worship. Declaring himself a follower of Ardanor, the Azhraic Mnabran Empire was born. Alluding to its more majestic past, but now under the religion of the Vallonae, the AME was a period of relative peace, and a model for Kyros.

The AME continued its trend of decentralization, as Hieresseth no longer had the resources to govern it in a top down manner. It split into regions, with a local lord, called the Alred, protecting it. This structure was maintained later under Coronese rule as a convenience, and continued by Kyre after the revolution. The Alredreans are the social structure of the land.

Ogaratu numbers continued to dwindle. Birth rates fell for them, for reasons unclear. Some say Azhgog had brought a curse upon them, or that Nadenda looked upon them with disfavor. After a few centuries, there were no longer enough Ogaratu to maintain the officer core within the army, and so the roles went to Vallonae.

So officially still an empire, the AME existed only in southern Caestia, was merely a federation of local regions, and who’s ruling class no longer had enough population to maintain their position.

Finally, in 1281 AE, Adric the Conqueror of Coron, and four dragons, including Gorgorathazayr, appeared around Hieresseth, burning it to the ground. AME was overthrown, and the Coronese provinces of Cadria and Nordria were established. The remaining Ogaratu fleed, returning to Ogarataere. A new city, Cadro, was built on the ruins of Hieresseth.

Mnabra had finally fallen after over 9000 years.
