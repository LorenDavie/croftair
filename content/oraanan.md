# Oraanan
Oraanan is the land surrounding the Oraan river in northwestern Caros. Controlled by the Crondar in the Elder Age, the Oraan was critical as a transportation artery from the Bay of Solrien to Crassix Cron, the Crondar capitol.

In the latter Empire Age Oraanan fell under control of the migrating Keerag Macai, having split from the Scalarae. Later it became part of the Entreaan Empire.

By the middle Coronese period, Crassix Cron was abandoned, and Oraanan was completely under human control.
