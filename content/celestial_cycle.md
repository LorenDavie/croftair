## Book I: Sgarethorn

Nalitaq Thanakroth, the Dark Hand, is poised to conquer all of the former colonies of Coron.  Through his puppet, Amberion Kanen, the Emperor of Solrundria, his fleet is about to sack Takhmir, the capital of Rondara, home of the Aeranar (the Blue Lords). However, the Aeranar magus Vargos Zorn, in a desperate move, reaches out to four other random sorcerers scattered about the world and with them summons the Illiaka: the Agent of Law - a being to counteract Nalitaq. The enchantment is cast, just before Nalitaq's servant Aaxxon the Slayer reaches Zorn. But Zorn has anticipated this: he is at the Giant's Table, from where one can will themselves to any place in Ardruin. He disappears as Aaxxon approaches him.

The Illiaka turns out to be Argon Sgarethorn, a hero of the Coronese civil war. He was the enemy of Nalitaq, said to have been slain by Nalitaq some 500 years earlier.

The prophecy of the Illiaka is that they will wield Illiasor, the Sword of Law. Croftair is the Fourth Realm, it is explained, it was preceded by three other versions of the universe, each ending in its own apocalypse. Illiasor belonged to Gheihim, the First Being, as he lived on Mount Arakai in Ora, the First Realm. It was taken by Morakal the Betrayer and used to murder Gheihim. Later, in the Third Realm, Coros, it was wielded by Mynok of the Illai, Lord of Justice, and used to slay Krothorl the Devil. This battle led to the destruction of the cosmic mountain Arakai and of Coros, which is what led to the creation of the Fourth Realm, Croftair.

The five summoners can feel the presence of the Illiaka. They react in different ways. He brings Calgirna pain, so she sends zombies in an attempt to wipe him out. Mizradia is attracted to him. The presence of the Illiaka drives the five summoners, motivating their actions.

First he travels to Cadro where he finds the city in control of an Ogaratu family. Hyana Oreakhla, the Death Queen rules, using her son Davos as an enforcer. Davos wields one of the Daisor, a mark of Nalitaq. With the assistance of Mizradia and revolutionary Sy Soreth, Sgarethorn defeats and destroys the Ogaratu royals, while zombies sent by Calgirna attack the city. Davos lets it slip that they were introduced to the Dark Hand through the Pirate King of Bambavan.

Sgarethorn leaves Cadro and travels via ship to Bambavan, leaving Soreth to conduct his revolution. 

Bambavan is ruled by the Coronese Mordecai Raelsrahn, known as the Pirate King. Originally a Sokikai during the Draconic Revolt of 1836, he later received a Daisor and fell under Nalitaq's sway. His main function is to suppress naval activity of powers that Nalitaq does not control, especially the Aeranar.

Mordecai is conflicted: Sgarethorn is the founder of Sokikai and Mordecai's hero, but Nalitaq is pulling his strings. Sensing his conflict, Sgarethorn tries to free him. They duel and Mordecai nearly gets the upper hand, but Illiasor is too strong. Sgarethorn breaks Mordecai's Daisor, and frees him, unfortunately cutting off his hand in the process.

Mordecai cannot lead Sgarethorn to Nalitaq but tells him that he has agents within the Theranar themselves, a heartbeat away from the Amber Throne. Sgarethorn must defeat the Theranar agents and then use the Theracai itself to find Nalitaq. Mordecai knows that without the Daisor, madness via Nalitaq's curse will come for him. He lives on borrowed time now.

Meanwhile, Nalitaq finds the Death Queen dead. He cares nothing for the other Ogaratu royals, but Hyana was his lover. Incensed, he sends Aaxxon the Slayer to hunt Sgarethorn down. Aaxxon finds Sgarethorn on the Azyraad to Coron, but cannot overcome the power of Illiasor. He returns to Nalitaq with Sgarethorn's identity as the Argonan general who defeated Nalitaq 500 years before in the Coronese Civil War.

Sgarethorn enters Coron in secret. He infiltrates Cai Theran and discovers, to his dismay, Nalitaq's agent amongst the Theranar turns out to be the Daitheranar (chief dragonlord) himself. A lot of the power of the Theracai moves through the Daitheranar, especially when he is in Cai Theran. Sgarethorn tries to confront him, but even with Illiasor he is unable to defeat him. Sgarethorn is forced to retreat.

Sgarethorn finds the present day Sokikai and reveals himself to them. They let him know that the Theranar have become a force of lethargy and isolationism within Coron, always counseling the Daionara to let the former colonies to their own fate. They bring in Vargos Zorn.

Zorn meets Sgarethorn and explains that Nalitaq is making a "dark pattern" weapon: something that takes advantage of the underlying principles of the universe that Nalitaq found within the Theracai and bending them to his will.

The Sokikai get Sgarethorn into the Palace of the Dionara. Sgarethorn meets Alaec and convinces him of the threat of Nalitaq, describing the Dark Pattern.

Kirian, who never really wanted the Amber Throne, decides to abdicate. He announces his abdication to the imperial court, and tells them to follow Sgarethorn.

The Daitheranar takes a swift retribution. He summons all of the Daisor (save the Pirate King) and attacks. The attack comes when Sgarethorn is alone in the throne room.

To their surprise, Sgarathorn responds by destroying the Theracai (Dragon Glass) itself, destroying all of the Daisor, including the Daitheranar, and severely wounding Nalitaq.

Sgarethorn is summoned by Gorgorathazayr, the Great Old Dragon, who was ridden by the Daitheranar. Gorgorathazayr tells Sgarethorn that with the Theracai destroyed, the dragons of Coron will leave for Azyros. However they will grant Sgarethorn, their emancipator, one last boon.

Nalitaq knows he can't delay any more. He puts his plan in motion. Using shards of the shattered Theracai, he has made a Dark Dragon Glass: Therakroth. Placed in his moving Black Tower, Nalitaq will bind the underlying patterns of the universe to his will. Once he does so he will effectively be a god in Ardruin, with all mortals under his dominion.

Meanwhile, Sgarethorn travels to the Erudyzae kingdom that borders Coron: Impatchia. There he forms an alliance with the Queen. The Erudyzae recognize Sgarethorn as the Illiaka. While he is there, he has a dream of the future, with his Sokikai crying "Invirion!" while an enormous figure in red armor and a sense of doom approaches them.

Sgarethorn knows that, although he doesn't need to, Nalitaq cannot resist the chance to take Coron. He removes the Theranar from Coron and Nalitaq strikes, sending the Unkhala north on the Azyraad. But this is Sgarethorn's trap: in Impatchia two of the dragons wait, and render the Azyraad impassable. The Unkhala are forced to materialize in Impatchia, where the Erudyzae are waiting for them.

On the sea, the Solrundrian navy is attacked by the Kyros fleet, under the control of Sy Soreth. The battle seems to be going badly for the Kyrosians, but suddenly they are joined by the fleet of the Pirate King. The Solrundrians are routed. Mordecai dies in the battle.

Sgarethorn collects the remainder of his boon: riding Gorgorathazayr and with four other Dragons in tow, Sgarethorn and the Coronese attack the main Solrundrian army outside of Amberion. The world is reminded of the power of Coron.  Sgarethorn attacks the Black Tower directly with Illiasor, disrupting its ability to teleport away. Entering the Tower, Sgarethorn finds himself within the Dark Pattern, where he finds Nalitaq. He and the Dark Hand fight.

While fighting, Nalitaq mocks the supposed piety of Sgarethorn and Illiasor. Illiasor is not Gheihim's weapon, used by Morakal to slay him. Illiasor *is* Morakal. Gheihim was betrayed by his own fear, made manifest by Morakal. But Morakal was the Essence of Might, and could not be defeated by the Azhrai. So Arkrynn transformed him instead, changing him into Illiasor.

Within him, Sgarethorn hears Arkrynn speak to him: Morakal's might is immutable, but his form can change. channeling Arkrynn, Sgarethorn releases Illiasor's power and merges it with the Dark Pattern, destroying Nalitaq. The Black Tower, which contains Nalitaq's artificial Theracai, is destroyed.  Amberion Kanen is also slain in the battle. Sgarethorn is ejected from the newly created realm.

Victorious over Solrundria, Sgarethorn recognizes the need to fill the power vacuum left by the destruction of Nalitaq. He seals his legitimacy in an arranged marriage with Alyssa Kanen (one of the 5 summoners, and Amberion's daughter), and founds the Empire of Illisyn, a union of Coron and Solrundria. Alyssa becomes pregnant by him but secretly plots her revenge for the death of her father.  Before she gives birth, Alyssa acquires a splinter from the Dark Dragon Glass. She stabs Sgarethorn with it, and it proves capable of killing him.  Alyssa gives birth to Kane, the Celestial Emperor, ruler of the newly forged Empire of Illisyn.

The story takes place between 2000 and 2008 AE.

## Book II: Illisyn

The story picks up 8 years later, in 2016 AE.  Kane, the Celestial Emperor, is already showing unusual, godlike, power even though he is just a boy.  Specifically, he can "retreat" into an alternate reality, in which he can speak to the spirits of both Argon Sgarethorn and Nalitaq Thanakroth. This Realm is created by Illiasor, and came into existence when Illiasor disappeared.  At the same time, the 5 summoners of the Illiaka are visited by a mysterious vision, telling them that they are the Arcanai, and they must play a game, with the fate of the universe in the balance.   The Arcanai are introduced: Vargos Zorn, the exiled Aeranar, Mizradia and Zaraphon, secret offspring of Nalitaq and the Death Queen, Calgirna, the witch of the southern marshes of Kyros, and Alyssa, mother to the Celestial Emperor.

In flashbacks, the story also tells of the origin and youth of Argon Sgarethorn, back in the civil war period of Coron. Argon is an orphan, the son of minor nobility within the Barony of Argona.  He is taken in by the Daibaran, and is raised with his son, Aaron.  They meet a third, Rheadhrisse, an educated daughter of one of the chief councilors of the Daibaran.  The three become inseparable.

In the present, the Celestial Empire is rocked by the arrival of the Goships from Ulmuria.  The Ulmurians claim to come in peace, and seek an audience with the boy Emperor.  The Ulmurians demonstrate "chain walking" (Amien-Ka), their ability to manipulate the time flow, and "weaving": a parallel but distinct form of magic.  Weave is shown to be opposite and equal to Ikoniaka (Coronese sorcery). Conspiracies begin to form within the Illisyn capitol, to take control of the Ulmurian power.

In flashback, it is told how the youth Argon Sgarethorn meets the Last Edrain, an ancient warrior of an order that was wiped out by Nalitaq. The Edrain were founded by Edric himself, but fell out of favor during the long reign of Adric the Conqueror. Nalitaq, Adric's servant, hunted down and slew all of the Edrain, except for one. The Last Edrain recognizes the natural talent of Sgarethorn, and trains him. At the same time, the youths of the three friends pass.  Sgarethorn and Rheadhrisse start a relationship, and Aaron harbors jealousy.

Inspired by the Last Edrain, Sgarethorn starts the Sokikai. A warrior order dedicated to the Illai, and their specific interpretation of Azurica. Their motto and rallying cry is "Invirion!", which means something along the lines of "infinite honor". The order grows in strength and numbers rapidly.

In the present, the First Game of the Arcanai plays out.  Agents of Calgirna try, and fail, to assassinate Kane. Vargas Zorn allies himself with Kane and tries to establish a trade alliance with the Ulmurians. Zaraphon pledges himself to learn the secrets of Weaving from the Ulmurians. Alyssa tries to establish mental dominance over Kane, but is blocked by Vargos Zorn and Mizradia. However, she makes an alliance with the Theocrats of Adraria. The allocation of the Arcanai pool is redistributed accordingly. In the end, Zorn and Kane establish the rule of Illisyn, Mizradia becomes strong in the south, Alyssa is held in check within the capitol, Zaraphon quietly gathers power within the Ulmurians, and Calgirna is scarred and exiled.

In a flashback, Argon, now a grown man, husband of Rheadhrisse, and the General of Argona, discovers Nalitaq attempting to gain control over the Theracai itself.  Before he can act, the Daionara dies suddenly without an heir.  The Argonans accuse Nalitaq of engineering the death of the Daionara.  Aaron, however, sides with Nalitaq.  With no clear heir, factions split, and the Empire finds itself in a civil war.  The Theranar sit out the war in neutrality, and the power of Nalitaq is matched against the military genius of Sgarethorn.

Sixty-four years since the first game of the Arcanai, in the year 2080, the five sorcerers are visited again by the power, telling them they must once again play its game. Using her allies the Theocrats, Alyssa attempts to start a war between Ilisyn and UlCharre, ending the trade alliance that powers Kane and Vargos Zorn.  Calgirna, working together with Allysa, trap Mizradia and Zaraphon within a curse.  However, the siblings break the curse by creating the Abomination and destroying the spell.  Zaraphon discovers a way to combine Weave and Ikoniaka, creating integrated magic.  He makes the Bard Engine to power it.

In the final flashback, Sgarethorn is victorious in the war against Nalitaq.  Nalitaq is officially dishonored and driven from Coron.  However, he has his revenge against Sgarethorn.  Nalitaq captures Sgarethorn's personal guard and changes them into the Unkhala, the Dark Highwaymen.  He places Aaron in charge of them, whom he alters to become A'axxon the Slayer.  The Unkhala attack and slay Sgarethorn's family, including Rheadhrisse, while he is away.  Later Sgarethorn is captured and tortured by Nalitaq.  He is discovered by the Last Edrain, who mercifully kills Sgarethorn, releasing him from torment.

In the present, Mizradia and Zaraphon work together to destroy the Theocrats in the Night of Terror. Kane is attacked by the Knights of the Seven Rods, again at the behest of Alyssa.  Unable to defeat them, he retreats into Kane's Realm.  Vargos Zorn brokers a peace, offering Zaraphon to return to Ulmuria and teach the Arcanai's art to the UlCharre.  The Arcanai pool redistributes, leaving Zorn and Mizradia as the clear winners.

## Book III: Arcanai

It is the year 2144 AE, 64 years after the Second Game of the Arcanai. The world has been changed by Zaraphon's Bard Engine and the integrated magic it provides. Mizradia rules Adraria, Zaraphon has lived in Ulmuria, Zorn has retreated from Amberion back to Takhmir, since in Kane's absence Alyssa's power in Illisyn has grown.

In Azyros, the city Karazyr is invaded by two dragons, Curinathazayr and Aryazayr, who wipe out the human Talisor population.  A Talisor warrior named Eressa is among the casualties, and is personally slain by Aryazayr.  Capturing the city gives the dragons access to Ardruin, and the surviving Talisor become the Therakyn: the thralls of Curinathazayr and Aryazayr.

Without the Theracai to control them, even just two motivated dragons represent an existential threat to the mortal world.  As the Therakyn arrive in mass, materializing on the Azyraad near Corvanda, Vargos Zorn moves to counteract the threat. He recalls Zaraphon back from Ulmuria, and sends him to find the Tarazyr: the original gem from which the Zairn Scrolls were derived.  It is thought that the Tarazyr lies within the Tomb of Arik, which is in turn held within the Mnabrarkh, deep below Cadro. Vargos Zorn also ruminates on the absent Celestial Emperor. Kane remains within his realm, unreachable.  Zorn and the other Arcanai also know that the Third Game is approaching.

Eressa, deceased, awakens in Corboros.  Her spirit is captured on the Web of Umbora and placed into her Corboros body.  She is lowered down the side of Takh Sgarae into the city below. Eressa is targeted by reavers who want to steal her body.  She fights them off, and is assisted by a mysterious ally.  The ally tells her to accompany him to somewhere safe. He explains that soon she will feel the call to the Courts of Destiny, where she will be judged by the Lords of Doom.

Meanwhile, in Tisakhmir, Mizradia, now the ruler of Adraria, bears the brunt of the Therakyn invasion.  Destroying towns along the road between Corvanda and Tisaskhmir, the vanquished are raised as more Therakyn, to join their army, which now consists of both the Talisor and the Corvandans. The second most powerful Arcanai, Mizradia meets the Therakyn army on the Road outside of Tisakhmir, and holds them there in a terrible battle.

The city Cadro is held by the Sons of Kadimac, following Sy Soreth's rebellion during the Celestial War. With their uneasy help, Zaraphon descends into the bowels of the city: below the cellars of Cadro lies the ruins of Hiaresseth, the capitol of Mnabra.  And below that, the entrance to the Mnabrarkh, the Great Vault of the Mnabra, which bore the Vallonae and Macai peoples from the Third Realm to Croftair.  Therakyn agents seek to stop them, and when they finally acquire the Tarazyr, the Sons of Kadimac attempt to take it from Zaraphon, betraying him. Zaraphon is a step ahead, however, and escapes them.  Background on the Nessarkha is given.

Defeated by Mizradia, Aryazayr seeks a way to defeat the Arcanai.  Recognizing the source of their power as Oruzayr, Aryazayr seeks out Calgirna - the least successful of the Arcanai.  Seducing Calgirna, Aryazayr plots to poison the Arcanai Pool, defeating all of the Five at once.

Eressa has spent a long time training with the mysterious ally, who teaches her superior fighting skills, and how to lead an army, as well as delaying her judgement.  Finally, Eressa stands in judgement in the Courts of Destiny.  After witnessing the judgment of others, including ascension to Aeros, return to Corboros and damnation into the abyss, Eressa is judged by the Lords of Doom.  They decide that she is virtuous enough to take the Grey Road to Azyros, where she may remain, or from there take the Bridge of Light into Eluwyn.  Instead of immediately taking the Grey Road, however, Eressa returns to Corboros as a citizen.

Mizradia detects a malignancy in the Arcanai Pool, draining its power.  The defenses around Tisakhmir weaken, and the city is swarmed with Therakyn. Mizradia cuts loose with some serious destruction on the Therakyn, but ultimately must flee Tisaskhmir.  The citizens are harvested by the Therakyn.

Zaraphon attunes himself to the Tarazyr and sees the source of the corruption in the Arcanai pool. Entering the pool, he seeks to repair the damage.  While doing so, he internalizes the entire pattern of the pool, realizing that it is the Theracai, and is in fact Oruzayr.  In this realization, Zaraphon becomes the Daiarcanai.

The power of the Arcanai restored, Vargos Zorn seeks out Aryazayr.  In a tremendous battle over Tisakhmir, the wizard and the dragon destroy each other.

Eressa, having secretly recruited the victims of the Therakyn, leads an army of the dead.  Overcoming the wardens of the Lords of Doom, they travel the Grey Road into Azyros, then follow the secret paths of the Talisor into Ardruin, still wearing their Corboros bodies.  Joining the remaining Arcanai, they meet Curinathazayr and the Therakyn on the plains of Solrundria. Zaraphon arrives and, as the Daiarcanai, takes control of all draconic power using the authority of Oruzayr.  Curinathazayr and the Therakyn are wiped out.  The army of the dead collapse into ash, the Corboros bodies unable to survive long in Ardruin.

As the Daiarcanai, all the secrets harbored by Oruzayr flood into Zaraphon's mind.  He discovers something terrible, and disappears.

## Book IV: Midori

It is the year 2208 AE, yet another 64 years after Koratherakyn, the war of the dragons.  In the south, in Adraria, the Kazien have risen to fill the power vacuum left behind by Mizradia.  All of the surviving Arcanai vanished following Koratherakyn except for Alyssa, who still controls Illisyn, and it is thought that the Games will end. However, the portents of them have come again. The Sokikai have detected this, and seek out one of their inactive warriors, Jhered Varegeln, to stop the Game before it begins again.

The Sokikai commander and his lieutenant Freadhrisse meet Varegeln in Caidion, and explain to him that the portents revolve around a mythical and ancient pair of books known as the Midori.  Doramaya is the Book of Pleasure, authored by the primal goddess Amaya, and Dorakedak is the Book of Pain, authored by the primal goddess Akedake.  Within is apparently the secrets of the mechanism behind the Aracanai games, which rumor has it is counting down to the end of the universe.  Freadhrisse is to accompany Varegeln in the search for the books.

Jhered is a Kanai.  He is visited by visions of Kane's Realm, wherein he finds the spirits of Nalitaq, Sgarethorn and Kane. His visions find them sitting at a five sided table, with a door behind each chair (representing the Pentagata).  Two of the five seats are empty.   The spirits will answer his questions, but there is an ominous sense whenever he encounters them.

The goddess Sisters are worshipped by the Ogaratu who, having been cast from Kyros by Sy Soreth, have set up a new country farther up the river Tfar in Caestia.  Varegeln and Freadhrisse are to travel to Cadro, and from there up river to investigate within Mnabros, the Ogaratu state.

When Varegeln and Freadhrisse arrive in Cadro they are to be met by the Aeranar, but find that they have all been slain. Varegeln has terrible dreams, and the spirits of Kane's Realm warn that he is being pursued by a terrible enemy.

The two Sokikai travel upriver, and view the divided land that was once Kyros.  Following Soreth's revolution, there was civil war and the nation divided into three: Soreth's Kyros controlled Cadro north of the river, the Ardanorians control Danoros to the south, and upriver the Ogaratu control Mnabros.  There are frequent skirmishes, and an uneasy detente is the best state to be had.

In Mnabros, the Sokikai discover an elderly Ogaratu curator running the "Museum of Hieresseth".  There they find that the Sisters created the Midori, but the books themselves were destroyed in the Twilight in Coros.  However the secrets within were transferred into a more sturdy vessel: Oruzayr, the Primal Dragon.  It was the ritual of transference that Arik interrupted when he discovered Oruzayr in her crystalline (Theracai) state and rescued her from the Ogaratu.  But the ritual had already preceded enough: the secrets of the Ogaratu had been placed into Oruzayr's immortal mind.

It is now known that it is Oruzayr who powered the Arcanai.  They reason that if they can find one of the Arcanai, they can try to extract the secret.  As it turns out, Calgirna resides in Mnabros, so they try to find her. They locate her in her natural habitat, the scrub outside the main city.  But as they approach her, a stranger appears with terrible powers.  Seemingly a living void, the being absorbs all magic, leaving flux in its wake.  The Sokikai are unable to stop it, and it absorbs Calgirna, annihilating her.

Freadhrisse awakens and finds Jhered wandering disoriented. She snaps him out of it and they speculate that the void creature is also on the trail of the Midori, or is just targeting the weaker Arcanai, trying to absorb the pool through them. They consider going to Alyssa, the Empress Mother, for help, but reject it because of her capricious reputation. Instead they decide to try and seek out Mizradia. Jhered seems ill, but they decide to press on.

Using the Azyraad, they return to Caidion, where it is rumored that Mizradia has retired. Within Kane's Realm, Jhered is told that they are pursued by Morgatu the Abomination, a being of anti-magic. He will consume powerful magics and leave nothing but flux in his path. It is also on the hunt for the power of the Midori. The Nalitaq-ghost shows Jhered where in Caidion they can find Mizradia.

Mizradia is no longer drawing much power from the Arcanai pool, but is still a powerful sorcerer. From her offices in Caidion she runs the Zorn Institute, dedicated to finding a path out of the portents of doom represented by the Arcanai Games. She seems to recognize Jhered and is very concerned by his presence, but doesn't explain. She suggests that they really need to find Zaraphon. He absorbed most of the power of the Arcanai Pool at the end of the Third Game, so is most attuned to any secret of Oruzayr's.

Later the Zorn Institute is attacked by Morgatu. The sorcerers that work there mount a valiant defense, but are consumed by Morgatu. Mizradia is destroyed.

Jhered and Freadhrisse hear of Mizradia's destruction and think that they are being pursued by the dark stranger. Jhered enters Kane's Realm and finds the Celestial Emperor. Kane tells Jhered that he is pursued by Morgatu the Abomination. Child of brother and sister Zaraphon and Mizradia, Morgatu is anti-magic.  He will absorb and destroy whatever magic he can, and he is hunting the Arcanai Pool. Kane tells Jhered that his fate is entwined with Morgatu's.

The Sokikai are attacked by the Coroncai, who are attempting to prevent them from finding Zaraphon, but they are stopped by a mysterious magic. The Coroncai warn them that their actions are causing the cycle to progress. Following an obvious trail they are led to the mysterious Daiarcanai.

Finding Zaraphon, it is revealed that Jhered is really Morgatu. Zaraphon explains that Mizradia and he created the Jhered personality to try and let Morgatu live a normal life. When Zaraphon became the Daiarcanai, he absorbed the Midori from Oruzayr.  It consists of two secrets:

The Lesser Secret is that the three main contenders for supreme being (Orunai the Guardian from the Azhraic religion, Adrar from the Adrarian religion and Gheida Oru from the Ulmurian religion) are in fact all the same entity: Taeraevalai - the Three Faced God.

The Greater Secret is the True Name of Taeraevalai. To speak the name is to reset the universe, ending Croftair and (maybe) creating a Fifth Realm. So terrible is the burden of this secret, that Zaraphon has devised a means to rid himself of it. He has drawn Morgatu to him.

Jhered becomes Morgatu and consumes Zaraphon, absorbing the full power of the Arcanai Pool. It annihilates them both. The winner of the Fourth Game is Alyssa, and her power grows exponentially.

However Freadhrisse, the direct descendant of Rheadhrisse and Argon Sgarethorn, is pregnant by Jhered. Her child will be the heir to the throne of Illisyn.

## Book V: Daikanai

### Aryna

It is the year 2230. There is only one remaining Arcanai: Alyssa, and her power is great and terrible. The Arcanai Pool was released from Zaraphon upon his death, it was absorbed by Alyssa. She rules Illisyn, in the name of her absent son Kane, with her secret police, the Scarapai, enforcing her will.

But in Caidion, the Sokikai have secretly raised Aryna, the daughter of Jhered and Freadhrisse, from birth. She has inherited the skills of her ancestor Sgarethorn, and surpassed them, to become the greatest sword master to ever exist. She is now 21.

Aryna is also a Kanai, and can also speak to the ghosts, which now include Morgatu (and within him all the absorbed Arcanai). Unlike Jhered, Aryna can also communicate with the other visiting Kanai. At the Pentagata Table now sit Nalitaq, Sgarethorn, Kane and Morgatu (who in turn contains Zaraphon, Mizradia and Calgirna) and a fifth, Serissa Szal, the Empress of UlCharre.

The Games are in fact the acts of the universe itself, who is sensing an existential threat. All of Azurica, as passed from the Illai to the Coronese, has been in the service of dealing with the threat of the Destroyer. A dark counterpart to Orunai the Guardian, Kharakh the Destroyer will enter Croftair and destroy it. The Games have been the universe attempting to mutate and develop a natural defense against Kharakh. Nalitaq believes that Aryna is that natural defense.

Meanwhile, in Amberion, Alyssa rules Illisyn.  She visits Freadhrisse in the dungeons, where the Sokikai is kept. They have tortured her for a long time, but Freadhrisse was careful to make sure that she did not know of Aryna's location. Freadhrisse tells Alyssa that Kane is gone, permanently retreated to his Realm, and that Aryna is the true heir. The people know, and her time is running out. Alyssa initiates a fresh round of torture for her.

Alyssa could magically sense Aryna's birth, but her location has been kept obscured. She suspects that the Sokikai are moving against her. She also suspects that the Fifth Game is about to begin, but as the only remaining Arcanai, she's not sure what that means.

Alyssa reveals to her counsellors that she has placed a spy within the Sokikai to root out Aryna's location.

The spy passes Aryna's location to Alyssa, and the Scarapai are dispatched to slay her. Aryna is Aryna, however, and kills the Scarapai. More are coming, however, and her Sokikai masters tell her to flee. The spy, wracked with guilt (why?) sacrifices himself to buy her some time. Aryna is told to flee into the north, to seek out the Maze of Arkrynn.

In the north, at the Maze of Arkrynn, Aryna meets a mysterious figure who offers to prepare her for what is coming. It is the same being that assisted Eressa in Corboros, who trained Sgarethorn in Coron as the Last Edrain, and who met Azura before the founding of the Empire of Coron: Azryann, the Herald of Arkrynn, the only being that can freely move to anywhere in Croftair as he chooses. The being who has been advancing Arkrynn's will the entire time.

Azryann starts to train Aryna. He instructs her to start recruiting the other Kanai, of which there are far more than she thinks. They will be her army. Azryann presents her with a sword: **Vielle**, the Sword of Justice, forged by Mynok himself. As before with Azura, time moves differently at the Maze. Seven years pass for Aryna, but 40 years in the outside world.  The Army of the Daikanai gathers in the north. It is 2270. Aryna emerges from the Maze of Arkrynn and joins her army. The war against Alyssa has begun.

Vielle is linked to Kane’s Realm, and can channel powers from it as necessary. It can be unbreakable like Illiasor. It can channel the knowledge of Nalitaq, the strength of Sgarethorn etc. 

### The War With Alyssa

Aryna’s army takes Toreannon, the capitol of Garathos, causing Alyssa to retreat.  Alyssa has already tried to rain magical destruction down onto Aryna’s army, but Aryna is able to shield them with Vielle. 

Aryna is joined by an Ulchawan traveler named Mac Xama, who has sought her out at the advice of a mysterious wanderer who claimed she is the key to his destiny. Xama is the world's greatest Chainwalker, able to manipulate time and space around his person. With Xama's help Aryna is able to break the city Toreannon and capture it.

Alyssa has taken control of the Kazien, which join the Scarapai as her loyal followers. Alyssa works with her generals to stop Aryna’s march, expressing frustration with her side’s inability to stop her, even though they seemingly have superior numbers and power.

Alyssa is visited by a group who call themselves the Unatar, who inform her that she must stop Aryna. The Unatar’s leader is named Cabru. Alyssa recognizes him as a Kazien, but thought that he had died the previous year. The Unatar say that they will supply Alyssa with magic that can help, if Alyssa will swear fealty to them. Alyssa (who is the Empress Mother, after all) tries to kill them for their insolence, but they prove very, very durable. She realizes she is in the presence of a far greater power than her, and reluctantly accepts their help.

Aryna is marching on Amberion.  Alyssa is blocking the Azyraad, so they have to walk.  In camp, a few weeks away to the north, Aryna’s army is attacked by a disease.  A madness sweeps through the army, and they fall on each other, tearing themselves apart. Aryna and those closest to her and Vielle are unaffected, but the army is crippled. They know they will be unable to defeat Alyssa now. The curse of the Unatar has arrived.

Within Kane’s Realm, Nalitaq suggests there is a way to stage a coup within Amberion.  They can lead a strike force through the body of Kane, left in a state of being a three dimensional window into Kane’s Realm. Kane, who has been in a state of indeterminate existence since his retreat in 2080 knows that this will kill him for sure, but he is willing to sacrifice himself.  He thinks that he can join the strike force himself before expiring, once the rest of them are through.

Aryna leads the strike team, Xama accompanying her.  After her team has come though, Kane manifests himself within Ardruin one last time.  They break out of the tomb that has been built around Kane, and into the royal palace.  They fight with Scarapai and Kazien, and eventually find Alyssa.  Aryna and Alyssa fight, echoing the battle of Sgarethorn and Nalitaq hundreds of years before. In the end, Alyssa spots Kane, and is wracked with guilt for using him.  Alyssa dies by her own hand.  Aryna captures Amberion, but the Unatar escape.

In his last act, Kane publicly names Aryna as his heir.  He ages rapidly within Ardruin, and dies of old age within a few days. Aryna is now the Celestial Emperor.

### Invirion

> The Pentagata table needs five, and it was intended that they be Sgarethorn, Nalitaq, Kane, Morgatu and Serissa. However, Kane has died in helping Aryna reach the throne of Illisyn, and so now they are one short.  

Aryna is now the Celestial Emperor, and has survived one assassination attempt after another.  Mac Xama has become her lover and personal guard.

The Unatar are multiplying throughout the Empire, spreading chaos everywhere.  They seem to have no leader, no source of power. Whenever they are countered they spring up somewhere else, spreading chaos.

Aryna is visited by Azryann once more, who tells her that the final Game of the Arcanai is about to start (it is now 2272) and that Kharakh is coming. She must embark on a quest to stop him, or the world will fall. She must find the armor of Orunai the Guardian. Aryna must retrieve the armor, and use it to fight Kharakh.

Orunai’s Armor stood in the Cave of Gheihim on Arakai in the First Realm, and was in the custody of the Azhrai afterwards. It is believed that the Azhrai dwelled within the Armor when they were in exile in the void Unakroth. When they re-entered the universe in the Third Realm, the Armor was returned to Arakai.  When Arakai was destroyed along with the third realm, the armor was lost, or so it seemed.

Azryann tells Aryna that the armor was in fact sealed in the very bottom of Marinarkh, the vault that Hernessa built to save the Marin people.  However, they were all slain by the Ogaratu who had stowed away, and the Marinarkh became Azul Thal, the dark city of magic. 

After the Ogaratu broke free from Azul Thal, they spread over the new world of Croftair. In Ulmuria, they built the city of Telaza, and took the Armor there. Xama and Aryna will travel to Telaza and retrieve the armor, so it can be used against Kharakh. Xama will use his Chainwalking powers to get them there.

Xama chainwalks himself and Aryna to the outskirts of Telaza. They find the area under control of the Unatar. Sneaking in, they discover a disfigured and withered humanoid figure, from various parts of his body protruding seven iron rods. Under control of the Unatar, he chants ancient magics in the Aitheraka language. The fabric of reality seems to fray around him. Xama is horrified, realizing that they are looking upon the Dark Weaver himself. Controlled by an even greater power.

Within Telaza, they find a secret chamber where the Ogaratu have hidden the Orunai armor. Along the wall, they find a prophecy, which Nalitaq is able to translate for Aryna. The Armor is not for combat, it cannot defeat Kharakh the Destoyer. However it can save the world, as the Guardian. It says that the Sisters hold the secret: the Greater Secret of the Midori. Aryna must travel to Azul Thal, to contact the Sisters.

The Ogaratu inscription reveals the location of Azul Thal to Aryna.  Amazingly, the entrance to Azul Thal lies below the Amber Throne in Caidion, exactly below the chamber where the Theracai stood. When Zairn captured Oruzayr as the Theracai, it was something that could only be done in exactly that spot, because of Azul Thal. The spot was obviously magical, but it was assumed that it was magical because of the Theracai - no one ever asked if an older magic preceded it. (Nalitaq is furious at himself that he never figured this out when he was alive. Also, it means that the enchantment used by Zairn to summon Oruzayr and create the Theracai was in fact ancient Ogaratu Magic from Coros.)

Suddenly they are discovered by the Unatar. The Unatar's power is too much, in this place, to defeat. Xama tells Aryna to go, to take the Orunai Armor to Azul Thal. Aryna opens the Armor and steps inside. It immediately bonds with her, and by her will suddenly she finds herself in the Palace of the Dionara in Caidion, in Coron.

Mac Xama valiantly holds off the Unatar. He cannot kill them, as they are undead. Mortally wounded, he initiates one last chainwalk, traveling thousands of years into the past, to arrive in the court of the Emperor of UlCharre in the Lotus Dynasty. There, he fulfills his destiny by revealing the Xama Prophecy to them, before dying of his wounds.

The Palace of the Daionara mostly stands empty these days, but as the Celestial Emperor, it belongs to Aryna. She goes to the room where the Theracai once stood, directly below the Amber Throne. Using the power of Orunai, she drills down, down into the foundation of the palace, until she breaks through and finds the Seal of Marinarkh, defaced with ancient Ogaratu glyphs. Aryna enters Azul Thal.

Aryna faces many horrors within Azul Thal, not the least of which is a creeping insanity left over from the cataclysm that destroyed the city so long ago, before the Dark Age. With the Orunai Armor she overcomes the horrors. She finds the Temple of the Sisters, the ancient Ogaratu shrine to the oldest gods.

Cabru appears. He tells Aryna that she has been tricked. The Unatar required the creeping madness of Azul Thal to infect the Azyraad, softening the universe and enabling Kharakh's entrance. In the Temple is the very last Jar of Madness, an ancient weapon of the Ogaratu. Cabru will take it back to Telaza where it can be used to finish the ritual to summon Kharakh. Aryna has led them to it. Cabru closes the Seal of Marinarkh, entombing Aryna in Azul Thal.

Through Akana, Aryna reaches out to Serissa Szal, telling her to deploy the Immortal Army to Telaza now. Kharakh is coming.

The Horrors start to close in around Aryna, she holds them off with the power of the Armor, but they keep coming. When all seems lost, a great light fills the room, and the Horrors flee.

Aryna finds herself in the presence of the two Sisters. They tell her that the Armor has chosen her, as it had chosen their mother before. Azryann thought the Armor could be used against Kharakh, but that is not its function.

Aryna is to reach into Akana and pull the entire domain, including all the Kanai, into the Armor. As the Guardian, this is its purpose. It alone can survive Iai: the reset of Cor, the end of one Realm and the beginning of the next.

Aryna asks the Sisters who they are. She thought they were Gheihimin. They explain to her that they are not Gheihimin, like the Azhrai. They precede them, as did their youngest sister, Gheihima.

Aryna draws Kane's Realm, and all the Kanai to her, and contains them within the Orunai Armor, including Serissa Szal. Within Kane's Realm, Aryna takes her seat at the Pentagata Table, becoming their fifth. The greater secret of the Midori is the reset of Cor, and the means to survive it. The Sisters speak the true name of their mother. There is a flash, and Cor resets. Croftair ceases to exist, and Kharakh is expelled back into Unakroth.

Aryna awakes and finds herself on a mountainside. It is Arakai, restored. The Armor stands alone in the Cave of Gheihim, having released Aryna and all of the Kanai. Serissa any many Ulmurians are there, as well as the other members of the Pentagata made flesh again. The mists start to roll back, and she sees the other Kanai start to wake. Inviros, the Fifth Realm, has started.
