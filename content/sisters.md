# The Sisters

The secret of the Midori was originally held by two beings called the Sisters: old goddesses of obscure origin, the main focus of worship by the Ogaratu. The origins and nature of the Sisters is disputed.

Azhraic tradition holds that the Sisters are Gheihimin from Ora that remained neutral in Korath Azhrai. They somehow avoided burning up in the Cosmic Flame when the Azhrai released it from the body of Gheihim, and were present again in Coros, already in possession of the Midori, presenting it in its original book form to the Ogaratu, who then transferred it to Oruzayr. Azhraic myths aren't clear on how this occurred.

Ogaratu legend holds that they were a lost and evil people while they were in Azul Thal. However, when they unleashed the evil that destroyed the Hanging City, they were rescued by the Sisters. From that point onward the Sisters became the center of Ogaratu religion.

The two Sisters are Amaya, the Goddess of Pleasure, and Akedake, the Goddess of Pain. They do seem to be older and almost more primitive than the Azhrai, raising doubts about the idea that they are Gheihimin. For example, they are not bound by Krynna, Arkrynn's will in Croftair, indicating that they are the greater power.

At the very end of the Celestial Cycle, the Sisters speak to Aryna Daikanai as she floats outside the Universe, within the Orunai Armor. They say that Gheihim was actually Gheihima, a third Sister, and the youngest of them. The three of them are the daughters of a being named Acora, who some speculate is a fourth face of Taeraevalai. Their true nature is not revealed, but they were at the beginning of the universe, and Gheihima volunteered to enter Cor and give it life. Only after Morakal slew her did the other two Sisters start to get involved in the events of Cor.
