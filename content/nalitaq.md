# Nalitaq Thanakroth 
Without a doubt, the most talented sorcerer to ever live, Nalitaq, called the Dark Hand, has greater insight into magic than anyone else, and whose power was only exceeded by Zaraphon Barad as the Daiarcanai.

## Childhood and Early Career
 Nalitaq was born as a commoner in the service of the infamous House Carronai, in Coron. The Carronai had a reputation as sadistic and cruel, and Nalitaq was abused at their hands as a child. He became obsessed with survival and revenge. Unfortunately for the lords of Carronai, Nalitaq was also a genius.

Secretly, Nalitaq stole into the Carronai library and taught himself magic. A true natural sorcerer, Nalitaq, on his own efforts, became a capable magician by the age of 14.  Gathering his strength, he plotted his revenge on his Carronai tormentors.

At  a huge feast, Nalitaq saw his chance, and showed the world for the first time just how deadly he could be. Introducing a magic drug into the food, the Carronai all fell asleep at Nalitaq’s hands. When they awoke again, they knew a new meaning of horror.

They found themselves awake, and beheaded - their bodies already burned - but kept alive magically. Stacked neatly in a pile, in front of a mirror so they could see themselves, the Carronai saw their grizzly fate. For hours the magic kept them alive, watching their slow impending doom. When the spell finally lapsed, a generation of Carronai was wiped out.

Nalitaq joined a band of outlaw brigands who rode the outer fringes of Coron, terrorizing Uthasa villages, raping and pillaging. In a fairly short period of time, Nalitaq became the leader of the band, and under him they became infamous.

Finally the Edrain took matters into their hands. Sending out an expeditionary force, they cornered the brigands and, in a fierce battle, wiped them out. Only Nalitaq, through magic, managed to escape. His identity as the leader of the brigands was never revealed.

## Academic and Magical Career
His past as a brigand a well kept secret, Nalitaq forged noble credentials for himself as a son of an obscure House called Latiq. There was no such house, but Nalitaq’s illusion was intricate and convincing. He joined College of Pvarai, one of the two oldest of the Boric Ikoniaka, the Colleges of High Sorcery.

At Pvarai Nalitaq proved himself a prodigy beyond anything they had ever seen. Easily mastering the basic material, Nalitaq swiftly moved into extremely advanced practice, and was soon breaking new ground for the College.

It is during this period it is believed that Nalitaq underwent the Ritual of Karzynai. Magically tethering himself to the future event of Karzakarkaroth, when Cor is destroyed, he stopped his aging, making himself immortal. Free from the constraints of mortality, Nalitaq took his time, becoming the greatest sorcerer ever.

## In the Service of Adric
Eventually Nalitaq’s accomplishments came to the attention of the Dionara, Adric the Conqueror.  Soon Nalitaq served in Adric’s court. At Adric’s command, Nalitaq soon was looking for a way to send troops outwards more efficiently with magic.

Nalitaq discovered research from almost 800 years earlier outlining how to control the Azyraad through the Theracai. With Nalitaq’s guidance, Adric learned how to control the movement of troops upon the Azyraad, accelerating their movements and surprising foreign armies, as Coronese troops seemed to materialize out of thin air around them. With this power, Coron conquered Mnabra, the plains of Solrundra, the northern and eastern coasts of Culwais, and many other lands.

From Adric, Nalitaq learned to aspire to greatness, and to be utterly ruthless in that aspiration. While the Carronai were merely cruel for the sake of being cruel, Adric employed both cruelty and kindness as weapons in his quest for ultimate ascendancy.

In the course of these studies, originally simply following Adric’s commands, Nalitaq spent more and more time studying the Theracai itself. Its nature largely not understood even by the most advanced of Coronese sorcerers, Nalitaq wondered about the nature of the thing that their society was built upon. He made it his mission to better understand the Theracai.

Finally, remembering his defeat at the hands of the Edrain, Nalitaq managed to convince Adric that the knights of Edric did not have his best interests at heart. Almost overnight, Adric wiped out the Edrain, an order founded by Edric himself at the beginning of the Empire.

## The Death of Adric, Darkness and Civil War
Eventually Adric, whose life spanned the entire Imperial Era, finally died in an immense battle. His son Arvic ascended as the new Dionara. Arvic was weak and irrational, and soon fell under Nalitaq’s sway.

It is also during this time that Nalitaq is said to have changed. Perhaps it came from probing too deeply into the Theracai, perhaps it came from having to follow the fool Arvic, but Nalitaq’s thirst for power expanded immensely.

Nalitaq began searching for a way to directly control the Theracai, a power that was meant to be reserved for the Dionara alone. Long he tried to bring it under his control, while it eluded him.

Then one evening, when Nalitaq was locked into study and experimentation with the Dragon Glass, he was accidentally interrupted by Argon Sgarethorn. Sgarethorn, realizing was Nalitaq was doing, barely escaped.

Soon thereafter Arvic died mysteriously. Many believe he was poisoned by Nalitaq, although the protection of the Theracai should have made that impossible. The cause of his demise has never been made entirely clear.

Without a strong candidate for the next Dionara, the country quickly divided into factions. The Theranar were supposed to choose the next Dionara, but were silent. It is believed that they were commanded to silence by the Theracai, which they could sense through their bound dragons.

One interpretation of these events suggests that they were all at the design of the Theracai itself. That the corruption of Nalitaq, the discovery by Sgarethorn and the commanded silence of the Theranar were all at the design of the Dragon Glass, in an attempt to initiate a series of events that would free it from the secrets of the Midori. The Theracai, who after all was the Cosmic Dragon Oruzayr, would be able to look into the future and initiate events to produce a desired outcome.

Regardless, the country eventually faced off with two main factions: Nalitaq, Pvarai and several Great Houses on one hand, and Sgarethorn, House Argona and The College Soki on the other. Civil war ensued.

Nalitaq had powerful magic on his side, but Sgarethorn proved to be a genius strategist. Outflanked, Nalitaq’s faction was soundly defeated, ending the war. The Theranar, finally unblocked, selected a neutral third party as the next Dionara. Nalitaq was declared /unkhul/ and banished.

Nalitaq had his revenge on Sgarethorn, however. He captured Sgarethorn’s personal Sokikai guard and warped them into the /Unkhala/, the Dark Highwaymen. To lead them he took Sgarethorn’s childhood friend, Aaron, the heir to House Argona, and changed him into the hideous A’axxon the Slayer.

A’axxon led the Unkhala to Sgarethorn’s home and their slew his wife Rheadhrisse and their children. Sgarethorn was captured and brought to Nalitaq for eternal torture but was mercifully slain by the arrow of the Last Edrain.

## The Dark Pattern
In exile, Nalitaq continued to develop his understanding of magic over the next century. About 100 years after the end of the Coronese Civil War is considered when Nalitaq arrived at his Unified Field Theory, and began construction of the Dark Pattern.

The Unified Field Theory (UFT) states that all reality is ultimately constructed of magic: creative power originating from the body of Gheihim. All forms of reality: physical, magical, metaphysical, logical and so on can be unified at the base level of the post-Gheihimic field. Therefore, sufficient mastery of magic leads to mastery of reality.

Based on the UFT, Nalitaq began construction of a great engine, made of magic and existing with almost no physical manifestation, that would record, adapt and learn about the magical functions of the universe, feeding the extracted knowledge directly into Nalitaq. Nalitaq named this engine the Dark Pattern. It functioned in many domains, but the bulk of its work was done in Azyros, where it operated without detection. With the Dark Pattern ever expanding his knowledge and power, Nalitaq’s capabilities as a sorcerer increased yet again by an order of magnitude.

In 1687, Nalitaq began the first of his actions to consolidate power in Ardruin. He first created a pocket of physical reality within Azyros, making the “Impossible City” of Karazyr. He then kidnapped an entire town of Uthasa peasants from the Coronese countryside, and brought them to his new city.

Nalitaq presented himself as their new lord. Their old lives were over, he explained, but new and better lives awaited. They would live in Karazyr, protected, fed and cared for. In return the able bodied amongst them would act as guides along the Azyraad throughout Ardruin. The Uthasa largely went along, as Nalitaq’s new offer was considerably easier than their old life. A few dissented, and Nalitaq quietly got rid of them (probably feeding them into raw Azyros, where they could not have survived).

At the same time, Nalitaq commanded the Unkhala, whom he still controlled, to destroy any traveler in the Azyraad not accompanied by the Uthasa peasants. Nalitaq started to refer to the two groups (the kidnapped Uthasa and the Unkhala) as his “short sword and long sword”, respectively. The name stuck for the peasants, and they were thereafter known by the Onaran term for short sword: /talisor/.

It is through these means that by the mid 1700s Nalitaq effectively controlled travel and trade throughout the west of Ardruin. It is thought that he was aware of Ulmuria at this point, but kept his distance because he was not ready to take on Gheida Unkh and the Gheidazi at that point.

## Leading Up to and during the Celestial War

In the last few centuries of the post Civil War Era, Nalitaq’s power moves became more aggressive and targeted, as the Dark Pattern accelerated his power. He made twelve magic swords, the Daisor, through which he could control their owners, and distributed them as gifts strategically. Through the Daisor Nalitaq gained control of Solrundra, Bambavan and Cadro. He gained the alliance of the Ogaratu Counts of Marsanthia and engineered their slow takeover of Kyros. Only the Aeranar of Rondara fully resisted him at this time.

Nalitaq decided to work through agents rather than openly declare himself the master of a nation in the fallen Outer Empire. Most effectively, he used the warlord Kaz Kanen of the sun tribes of Solrundra to unify their lands into a newly charged empire to challenge Coron. The Empire of Solrundria was the new power, threatening whatever peace existed by the end of the millennium.

It is commonly believed that these more aggressive actions are what spurred the arrival of the Illiaka, but in truth the dominance of any nation within Ardruin over another was unlikely to be of interest to the Illai. The Illiaka is the single strongest reaction the gods have ever taken to any mortal action, and so bears deeper examination. There are two theories.

The first is that the Illai could project forward and see that the Dark Pattern would eventually lead Nalitaq to become powerful enough to challenge the Azhrai themselves. The Illiaka, therefore, was their attempt to stop Nalitaq before a conflict with him would be universe-threatening.

The second theory, not incompatible with the first, was that both Nalitaq’s rise and his fall at the hand of the Illiaka was a by-product of Oruzayr’s plan of self-annihilation, in order to rid herself of the Midori. Everything was in the service of destroying the Theracai, and then transferring the Midori to a human (perhaps with Nalitaq originally meant to be the recipient). In this case, the Illai are being somehow persuaded to activate the Illiaka by Oruzayr. Nalitaq’s potential threat would be a good argument, making the possibility of both theories being true simultaneously.

In any case, as history records, Nalitaq was finally slain by Sgarethorn, who released the power of Illiasor within the Dark Pattern. Nalitaq was killed in the blast, and his spirit was trapped within the newly formed domain of Akana.

## Half Life Within Akana
Nalitaq’s spirit did not travel to Corboros, as is normal for mortals. Instead he became the first resident of Akana. Sometimes physical, sometimes insubstantial, he wandered Akana’s lands, at first alone.

Nalitaq found himself in the strange position of having lost almost all of his power, while retaining the bulk of his knowledge. But beyond that, something fundamentally changed within him again. All of the rage and fury, and the lust for power that had driven him before was gone. In death, he had become content.

Shortly thereafter, Nalitaq detected another life within. At first, a baby that would flicker in and out of Akana, then the baby grew over time, becoming a boy. At first observing from afar, Nalitaq eventually introduced himself to the boy. He was Kane, the son of Sgarethorn, the young Celestial Emperor.

Over time other spirits joined Akana, including Sgarethorn, Nalitaq’s nemesis. But Akana held a kind of innate content within it, and conflicts from old lives seemed to be of little importance. Interest was primarily on what was happening in Ardruin, by those still alive. Nalitaq now in the role of counselor, tried to assist where he could, bringing his massive knowledge to bear on the problems of the Kanai mortals, eventually becoming the main counselor to Aryna Daikanai.

## After Croftair 
In 2272, well over a thousand years after Nalitaq’s birth, Croftair ended and Akana became the seed of Inviros, the Fifth Realm of Cor. The final fate of the spirit residents of Akana are unknown. Nalitaq’s spirit may have journeyed to Inviros, or it may have been lost with Croftair. In any case, the voices of Nalitaq and the other spirits of Akana ceased for Aryna Daikanai once Inviros was reached.
