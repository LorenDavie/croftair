# Realms of Cor

![Realms of Cor](images/realms-of-cor.png){: class="img-fluid" }

The Universe, Cor, has gone through five distinct phases, each of which contitutes a world or Realm. Each Realm (except the last, Inviros) ends with a catestrophic event.

The realms are:

## Ora

The First Realm, home of the Gheihimin, including Gheihim, the Prime Being, the Azhrai, and Morakal the Betrayer.  Ora ended in *Korath Azhrai*, when Arkrynn release the Fire Cosmic from the body of Gheihim.

The events of Ora occurred billions of years before Croftair.

## Aithera

The Second Realm, home of the Aitheraka (called dragons by mortals).  The Aitheraka rose as living entities from the Fire Cosmic, arranged into the seven Rings of Aithera.

Aithera ended in the events of *Ignian Arathazyr*, when the Cosmic Dragon Arathazyr attemped to absorb the power of the Azyraad, breaking the Fire Cosmic and causing it to decay down into physical reality.

The events of Aithera occured hundreds of millions of years before Croftair.

## Coros

The Third Real, also known as the Old World.  Coros was the birthplace of mortal life, including humanity, and the beginning of true physical reality. All humans in Croftair are descended from the ancient peoples of Coros.

Coros ended in *Korathoru*, when Krothorl the Devil invaded Cor, and was destroyed at terrible cost, causing the universe to shatter.

The events of Coros make up the bulk of Croftair's mythology, and occurred millions of years before Croftair.

## Croftair

The Fourth Realm, also known as the Divided Realm.  When Coros was destroyed the universe shatterned, but it was held together by the will of Arkrynn, through something called *Krynna*, or the Law of Equalization. Essentially every power in Croftair is carefully balanced against other powers.

Croftair is divided into seven Domains, to separate the powers.  Mortal life primarily exists within the Domain of Ardruin.

Croftair's history begins 100,000 BE (Before Edricara, the founding of the Coronese Empire) and ends in the year 2272 AE (After Edricara), during the events of *Korath Unatar*, when the Sisters reset the world to stop Kharakh the Destroyer.  It is succeeded by Inviros, the Fifth Realm.

## Inviros

Inviros is the Fifth Realm, the promised world of Azuraka, the Coronese religion.  Little is known of it, as it is only glimpsed at the end of the Celestial Cycle.
