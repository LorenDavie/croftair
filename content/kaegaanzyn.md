# Kaegaanzyn (Sungazer Isles)
Kaegaanzyn was first settled by the Mnabran Empire as their western most outpost.  As Mnabra declined, the Ogaratu masters abandoned the Vallonae they had brought there to their fate on the archipelago.

The Vallonae of Kaegaanzyn came to worship Solrun. They built great domed temples where they would stare into the sun, looking for enlightenment. The Kaegaan priests spoke of seeing the Face of the Sun, from within their domes.

Kaegaanzyn was annexed by Solrundria approximately 80 years before the Celestial Cycle. The Kaegaan Sun Domes were abolished in favor of the Solrundrian Imperial pantheon.  An armada of Solrundrian ships was stationed there.

After the Celestial War, Kaegaanzyn became part of Illisyn. Under Kane's rule, the Kaegaan people were allowed to return to their version of Solrun worship again. For a period of 64 years, between the First and Second Games of the Arcanai, Kaegaanzyn flourished once again.

However, under Alyssa's rule, the Kazien held influence, and Solrun worship was again outlawed. After the Third Game, Kaegaanzyn was ruled by Adraria, controlled by Alyssa's Kazien allies. Kaegaanzyn was recaptured by Aryna Daikanai during her brief rule, before the arrival of Korath Una in 2272 AE, when it was finally overwhelmed by the Unatar.
