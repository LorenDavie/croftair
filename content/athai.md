# Four Fundamental Forces
*An account by Serissa Szal, Empress of UlCharre*

In ancient times the physical world was thought to be constructed of five fundamental elements: *aera* (air), *azyr* (fire), *arda* (earth), *aluin* (water) and *una* (void). However modern magic, accelerated by the advent of Integrated Magic, has revealed a level of pure magical interaction on top of which all physical reality sits.

This fundamental scale is governed by four fundamental forces, which the Coronese have taken to calling the Athai. They are *una*, *coru*, *oru* and *ara*.

## The Athai
### Una
Una is the void force. In a potential universe where there can be something, or there can be nothing, Una seeks to push towards nothing. All existence of any sort is countered by Una, who seeks to tear it down. Una is thought to be the oldest force, and is clearly related to Unakroth, the Outer Void. Whether the Una force is a product of Unakroth or the other way around is unclear.

### Coru
The Coru force opposes Una. In a potential universe, Coru seeks that something exists. The Universe Cor is the testament to the existence of the Coru force. The Coru force operates on such a low level that it has nothing to say about the nature of what exists, it simply pushes against Una sufficiently for existence to occur.

### Oru
Our is the essential, or qualitative force. Once existence is established, the Oru force defines the character of that existence. Oru is closely associated with essentials such as Arkrynn and Hernessa, and the Realms themselves. Without Oru there could be existence, but it would have no properties.

### Ara
Ara is the dynamic force, and enables change, multiplicity and differences within existence. It is because of Ara that the universe is not completely uniform, and that all outcomes are not decided at the beginning. Ara would seem to oppose Oru, in that it promotes and deals with the non-essential elements of reality.

## The Relationship to Taeraevalai
The Lesser Secret of the Midori revealed to us that the three Supreme Beings forwarded by the world’s major religions are all different faces of one super-deity, which we call Taeraevalai (meaning Three-Faced God). The faces of Taeraevalai are Orunai the Guardian (from Azhraic religions), Gheida Oru (from Ulmurian religions) and Adrar (from Adrarianism).

However what has not been known until recently, is that the faces of Taeraevalai also map onto the Athai forces.

Orunai correlates to the Coru force. That is why Orunai is frequently depicted as a defender of the universe Cor, but never interacts with anything within the Universe.

Gheida Oru correlates to the Oru force. It is through Gheida Oru that fundamental characteristics of the Realms developed. First through the Gheihimin, then via Aithera, the Fire Cosmic, and then with the creation of mortal life in the Old World Coros. The fundamental nature of the Realms change through Gheida Oru, who represents the Oru force.

Finally, Adrar represents the Ara force. Revealed to his prophet Kazi late into Croftair’s history, Adrar represents a mortal-led change that rippled through late Coronese Imperial history and into the Celestial Era. Figures like Kazi himself, Nalitaq, Kadimac, Zaraphon and now Aryna Daikanai, represent the hands of mortals changing the fate of the universe. This is the Ara force at work.

## A Fourth Face for Taeraevalai
It is because of this mapping of the Athai onto the faces of Taeraevalai that we come to the realization that we have mis-counted faces. The weave-math cannot be wrong, and that means there must be a fourth face for the super-deity, one that maps to the Una force.

The ancient Ogaratu glyphs at Telaza speak of an anti-Guardian, another armored figure who opposed Orunai. They call this entity Kharakh.

I believe that Kharakh is a fourth face of Taeraevalai, one that embodies the Una force.  This means that their is a source of omnipotent power that is entirely dedicated to the destruction of Cor. As unpleasant as this conclusion is, it seems inescapable, given the evidence we now have.
