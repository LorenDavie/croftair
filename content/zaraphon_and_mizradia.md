# Zaraphon and Mizradia 

## Childhood and Early Adulthood 

Zaraphon and Mizradia are the bastard children of Hyana Oreakhla, the Death Queen of Cadro, and Nalitaq Thanakroth, the Dark Hand. Hyana and Nalitaq conducted a clandestine affair for many years. Hyana served as the main conduit for Nalitaq's influence over the royal family of Cadro (although later Hyana's legitimate son Davros became a Daisor, and therefore directly under Nalitaq's control). Mizradia was born in 1979 AE, and Zaraphon in 1981 AE.

Hyana realized that she had to hide the children from the king, and so they were raised in Sarro, across the bay from Cadro. Sarro was the center of Kyrosian sorcery, and so the siblings were taught magic from an early age.

As the siblings hit puberty they both discovered they were cursed (first Mizradia, then Zaraphon). They both consumed the souls of their sexual partners. It was an ancient Ogaratu curse designed to prevent the thinning of their bloodline, to prevent half breeds from propagating further. Mizradia started to surreptitiously take and consume lovers. Zaraphon, horrified, chose to remain chaste.

In 1997 Vargos Zorn visited Sarro and settled a conflict between the Kyrosian sorcerers and the Aeranar by means of a duel. Zaraphon witnessed the duel and saw Zorn soundly defeat the Kyrosian sorcerer. Impressed, Zaraphon asked to apprentice with Zorn. Zorn accepted and took Zaraphon back to the Aeranar that year, against the wishes of Hyana's minders. Mizradia remained behind and continued to study with the Sarro college.

In 1998 Mizradia returned to Cadro, now a grown woman. She stayed incognito, estranged from her parents. Setting up shop in the E'arosville neighborhood of Cadro, she became known as the Spider Woman, working magic for hire. Naturally gifted, she rapidly became one of the elite sorcerers of Cadro.

## Celestial War

On Year Day 2000, the Solrundrian Armada attacked Takhmir, where Zaraphon was studying. Enlisted by Vargos Zorn, Zaraphon participated in the ritual of the Illiaka. Using the broadcasting power of the Giant's Table, he reached out and enlisted Mizradia's help as well. Both of them were marked when the Illiaka arrived.

The following year, Mizradia became involved in a conflict with Calgirna, another of the Illiaka summoners, a witch who inhabited the Jezkraal swamp to the south of Cadro. The dispute involved control over an artifact called the Black Tears, a flask of black oil that could be used to control the minds of others. Mizradia had taken possession of it and was using it to increase her control of the city, bringing her into direct conflict with the Death Queen. Hyana heard rumors of the Spider Woman and her curse, and suspected that it was Mizradia. Seeking to neutralize her, she sent Davros to slay her.

However into the midst of this three way conflict strolled Argon Sgarethorn. Immediately recognizing the Illiaka, Mizradia sought to make an ally of him. Sgarethorn came into conflict with Davros and slew him. Mizradia assisted Sgarethorn's assault on the Royal Palace.

Calgirna chose this moment to attack Cadro with her army of zombies, and Mizradia found herself defending the city against them. The zombies were defeated and Sgarethorn destroyed the Royals. Into this power vacuum stepped Sy Soreth and Kadimac's Fingers. Mizradia managed to be recognized as an ally of theirs, since she had defended the city. She returned to E'arosville, now occupying the pyramid at its center, as the Alpha Sorcerer.

Both siblings were seriously affected by the destruction of the Theracai in 2005. Zaraphon continued to follow Zorn around throughout the Celestial War, acting as his apprentice as Zorn built alliances in Sgarethorn's wake. After 2005 Mizradia withdrew from Cadro. The Sorethian revolution was growing more bloody, and she sensed that her position was not tenable in the long term.

After the conclusion of the Celestial War in 2008, Zaraphon left the Aeranar (just before being recognized as an adept) and started wandering far and wide. Mizradia's whereabouts during this time were unknown, some think she may have been in Coron.

## The First Game of the Arcanai

On Year Day of 2016, the 16th anniversary of the summoning of the Illiaka, both siblings were awoken in the night by a terrible power. They were informed that they were players in the great game of the Arcanai. They were connected to the Arcanai Pool, a powerful source of magic, however they would have to struggle with the other Arcanai for their share of the power. Control of the world through geopolitical events would rule the outcome of the game.

Suddenly both Zaraphon and Mizradia found that their power had increased by an order of magnitude. They could cast spells of immense power, creating self-sustaining, semi-sentient “superspells”, capable of mass control, manipulation, creation and destruction. An Arcanai had the power to dominate a nation if they were clever about it.

Both siblings largely stayed out of the way in the First Game, letting Vargos Zorn, Calgirna and Alyssa battle for control of the Emperor Kane and the UlCharrean alliance. Zorn captured the prize of the first game, soundly defeating Calgirna and Alyssa. This left Zaraphon and Mizradia somewhere in the middle. They realized they would not be able to remain passive for another game, however, because the other players would draw them into the conflict.

The siblings discovered they stopped aging. The Arcanai Pool had rendered them immortal. This marked them as Karzaryn: they would be drawn towards Karzakarkaroth, the final battle.

Over the next 64 years, Zaraphon studied the Weave that the Ulmurians had brought with them from the East. Equal to and opposite from western Ikoniakia, the two forms of magic seemed completely incompatible. During this time, Mizradia sought out her Ogaratu roots (possibly looking for an escape from the curse), studying the ancient ways of Ogaratu magic.

## The Second Game of the Arcanai

In 2080, Zaraphon and Mizradia were drawn into the Second Game. Calgirna and Alyssa, in an alliance, made an aggressive move against the siblings, trapping them in a magical donnybrook. Any attempt at magic to break from the trap would result in catastrophe, since the trap drew strength from magic.

Mizradia determined a way to escape, drawing from her Ogaratu knowledge. If Zaraphon and Mizradia were to make love, Mizradia would give birth to a creature of anti-magic that could break the trap. Their curses would cancel each other out, so they would both be safe. Seeing no other means of escape, Zaraphon reluctantly agreed. The siblings had sex, and in a matter of hours Mizradia became pregnant and gave birth to Morgatu: a monster of anti-magic. Morgatu consumed the donnybrook, defeating Calgirna and Alyssa, and freed the siblings.

Afterwards, Mizradia and Zaraphon banished Morgatu to Azyros, on the theory that he could do less damage there, where there was no human civilization (save Karazyr).

Furious at what they had been compelled to do, Mizradia and Zaraphon attacked Alyssa’s stronghold, the Theocracy of Adraria.  In what was called the Night of Terror, the siblings wiped out the Theocrats, the Adra Caste, effectively toppling the government of Adraria in one night. In the morning, the siblings ruled Adraria. Zaraphon, not interested in ruling a country, left Mizradia in charge. He was unable to bear her company after that.

In the midst of all of this, Zaraphon had been inspired to a breakthrough in combining the powers of Weave and Ikoniaka. Using the two powers, he created a circuit that could manipulate both. Called the Bard Engine, he released it into the world, so any could build a source of magic and harvest its power: effectively democratizing powerful magic.

Zaraphon was contacted by his old master, Vargos Zorn. Zorn needed help sealing the peace with the UlCharreans, after Alyssa’s attempt to start a war. Zaraphon agreed to return to Ulmuria with the UlCharreans, since his heart was sick after the events of the Second Game. Zaraphon left for the east, and Mizradia ruled in Adraria.

For the next 64 years, Zaraphon wandered in Ulmuria, visiting and residing in UlCharre, Weyra and other places. He is said to have visited the Jeweled Tower of Telaza, and that he took one of the Gheidazi as a lover, discovering that they were immune to his curse. He learned much about Weave during this time, and traded his knowledge of the Bard Engine and Integrated Magic to the UlCharreans.

During this time, Mizradia ruled Adraria.  Officially an ally of Illisyn, she nonetheless maintained her independence, and addressed various threats from Alyssa, the Kazien, and the deposed Adra. Over time she grew to be known as a firm but fair monarch.

Meanwhile, Morgatu wreaked destruction within Azyros. Although no humans were in his path, he caused major destruction amongst the spirit world, and with the Aitheraka that inhabited Azyros. 

By 2144, two dragons, Curinathazayr and Aryazayr, decided to take matters into their own hands and retaliate for both Morgatu and the treatment of Oruzayr. They overthrew the Talisor in Karazyr, enthralled them as the Therakyn, and invaded Ardruin, moving their army through the Azyraad. This kicked off the Third Game.

## Third Game of the Arcanai

When the Therakyn army materialized near Corvanda, Vargos Zorn sent for Zaraphon to return to the west. Zaraphon returned and accepted Zorn’s mission to retrieve the Tarazyr from the Mnabrarkh.

The Tarazyr was the gem, legend had it, that Oruzayr gave to Arik back in Coros, when he freed her from the Ogaratu. It was said to be the basis for the Zairn Scrolls, which later became the foundation of Ikoniakia (Coronese Sorcery). The Tarazyr would represent a superset of all sorcerous knowledge, giving the Arcanai an edge in a battle against the dragons.

Much of the events of the Third Game and Koratherakyn, its associated war, are documented elsewhere. During the course of the Game, Zaraphon attuned himself to the Tarazyr and attained complete mastery of the Game, becoming the Daiarcanai. He absorbed about 90% of the Arcanai Pool, leaving the rest to be divided amongst the surviving three other Arcanai (Vargos Zorn was killed in combat with Aryazayr). Mizradia returned to something closer to her pre-Arcanai power levels, giving up Adraria. She moved to Caidion, the capital of Coron, and into semi-retirement.

When Zaraphon became the Daiarcanai, the spirit of Oruzayr dumped the knowledge of the Midori into his mind, finalizing a plan it had been executing for millennia. Suddenly Zaraphon had knowledge of the Lesser Secret (the existence of Taeraevalai) and the Greater Secret (the true name of Taeraevalai). Agonizing over the burden of the knowledge, Zaraphon disappeared.

Mizradia, relieved from the burden of the Arcanai power, felt remorse over Morgatu, especially once she realized his role in provoking the Aitheraka. She summoned him back to Ardruin, and implanted false memories and a new identity into him. Morgatu thought he was an ordinary Coronese citizen, a member of the Sokikai. Mizradia completed the illusion by falsifying others memories of him, fully integrating him into his new personality of Jhered Varegeln.

## Fourth Game of the Arcanai

Zaraphon spent a long time coming to terms with his burden as the Daiarcanai. The Arcanai Pool told him that, as the winner, he would lead the human race through a catastrophe so that they could survive. The Midori Secrets burned him, and at last he could take no more.

Zaraphon set in motion events that would lead Morgatu back to him, weakening the Jhered personality and releasing the monster within. Mizradia was consumed by Morgatu as an unintended consequence. Morgatu finally found Zaraphon in Coron and, after Zaraphon explained what was happening to him, consumed Zaraphon. The power of the Arcanai Pool was too much for Morgatu to consume, however, and he was also destroyed. The Arcanai Pool moved to the only surviving Arcanai, Alyssa Kanen, and made her the Daiarcanai.

Somehow during this period, Morgatu, in his Jhered persona, had become a Kanai: linked to Akana (Kane’s Realm). After his destruction, his image was reconstituted as a ghost within Akana, able to speak with the Kanai (especially with Aryna Daikanai, the daughter of Morgatu and Freadhrisse). Within Morgatu were the personalities he had consumed, including Zaraphon and Mizradia. In this way, the siblings continued to exist, able to council Aryna at the end of days.
