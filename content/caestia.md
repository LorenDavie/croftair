# Nations of Caestia

Caestia is the central continent in Ardruin, where the Mnabrarkh was located, and is the original home of the Vallonae in Croftair. Throughout the ages the lands have gone through many names and changes of government.

Originally the Vallonae settled the lands around what was later Cadro, and called their lands Vallonos. For nearly 2000 years they lived in peace, spreading slowly over Caestia and down into Culwais.

Then Vallonos was conquered by Pharakh Kal around 8000 BE, and the Empire of Mnabra was born. Conquering effectively all of the known world, the Empire dominated the age until it was itself conquered by the Coronese.

Under the Coronese, Mnabra became the province of Cadria, until Kyre led a revolution in 1917 AE, at which point the southern half of Cadria was renamed Kyros. Other fragments splintered off, and Kyros itself further split, with Danoros and Mnabros seceding during the Sorethian revolution.

## Kyros
Kyros was founded in 1917, named after the hero Kyre, who led a revolution against the Coronese. Kyros was ruled by the Vallonae, for the Vallonae, for almost 40 years, until it was cursed by the so-called Creeping Darkness in 1956. Under the Creeping Darkness, children would die indiscriminately in the night, madness swept through the nation, and food and grain would mysteriously spoil.

Priestesses of Umbora reported to the King that the kingdom had fallen under an ancient Ogaratu curse. The only way to repel it was to marry the Ogaratu back into the royalty. (The Ogaratu had been in exile since the Coronese invasion in 1281.) Reluctantly, the King married his daughter to an Ogaratu count from Marsanthia. Their offspring became the next king. To avoid another Ogaratu curse against halfbreeds the next king took an Ogaratu bride, and the royal family essentially was Ogaratu after that.

The capital of Kyros is Cadro, a city built by the Coronese on the rubble of Hieresseth, the Mnabran capital. Buried even deeper is the Mnabrarkh, where humans emerged into Croftair around 10,000 BE. There is a feeling of ancient timelessness that hangs over the city, rich with secrets. From the sorcerers of E’arosville, to Temple Row, to the Khara Halls of southside, Cadro is a city of secrets, adventure and danger.

Also of note is Sarro, across the bay from Cadro. Sarro is the home of the various Kyrosian orders of sorcery. Those that wish to study sorcery are sent to Sarro to learn.

## Emanthos
Part of the Druka empire in the Elder Age, the land that became known as Emanthos was annexed by the Mnabran Empire fairly early on. Legend is that it was conquered by Pharakh Kal himself. It was covered in forest, until the Ogaratu burned it down to flush out the remaining Druka. Later, Emanthos became another Coronese province, during which it was called Nordria. During Kyre’s Revolution, the Coronese forces were driven out of Cadria into Nordria where they held the line for a time, before collapsing when it became clear the Coronese Empire was not sending reinforcements. The Coronese voluntarily left Nordria in 1925, at which point the country renamed itself Emanthos (Freedom Land).

Emanthos recognized the authority of Kyre and the Kyrosian royalty, but remained somewhat distinct. Relations between the countries cooled further after the Ogaratu Reinstatement in 1956, but Emanthos officially remained an ally of Kyros until the Sorethian Revolution, when it sided with Danoros and the Ardanor Orthodoxy, against Soreth.

Emanthos is governed directly by an authority figure known as the Dane.

The landscape of Emanthos is dotted by large sculptures of heads carved from stone. These are called the Scarlaad, and are believed to date back to the Elder Age, perhaps being of Druka origin. The Scarlaad are believed to be magical, possibly guardians of the land of some sort.

## Scythos 
Scythos is the chain of islands linking the northern point of Emanthos with Coron. Sparsely populated, they were once Druka lands, but then uninhabited after the Druka were defeated by Erekeke. After the rise of Coron, the islands were patrolled and defended by the Theranar.

However, after the fall of the Outer Coronese Empire, some of the southern islands started to be populated by Emanthosi who ventured north. None would dare get too close to Coron, however.

## Syranthos 
An island located between Rondara and Kyros, and bounded by Corluin in the north and Saerluin in the south, Syranthos is home to the Temple of Dawn and Dusk, a unique temple dedicated to both Nadenda and Umbora. One building, split down the middle with light and dark sides, is dedicated to both the Goddesses of Life and Death.

The population is divided between the Temple priests and retinue, and the town of fisherman who support them. Both High Holidays of the two goddesses (Daienda and Diabor, respectively) are celebrated, as is a unique Feast of the Balance.

The Temple also has an extensive library dedicated to prose, philosophy and poetry about life and death.

## Marsanthia 
An island south of Kyros, Marsanthia was an Ogaratu stronghold dating back to the Dark Age. Relatively ignored throughout the Elder Age, only during the Empire Age were its Ogaratu inhabitants first encountered by the Vallonae who had emerged from the Mnabrarkh.

It was from Marsanthia that Pharakh Kal hailed. Discovering the land of Vallonos to the north, Pharakh led the Marsanthian Ogaratu north and conquered the Vallonae, starting the Empire of Mnabra in the process.

Marsanthia was conquered by the Coronese in 1286, shortly after the fall of Hieresseth, and remained under their control until Kyre’s revolution. It was a Marsanthian count that married back into the Kyrosian royal family in 1956.

The Marsanthian nobles were allies of Nalitaq Thanakroth early on, trading magical secrets with him. In exchange for Ogaratu magic, Nalitaq plotted the downfall of the Outer Empire to free Marsanthia from Coronese control.

Marsanthia is dotted with dark castles, which house the ancient Ogaratu families. The Vallonae peasantry lives in fear of the nobles, treating them like vampires.
