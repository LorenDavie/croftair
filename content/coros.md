# Coros
Coros, the Third Realm, also referred to as the Old World. It is the version of Cor that directly preceded Croftair. Most life in Croftair originated in Coros, including humanity. Although the events of Coros are treated as a kind of myth, they can be said to have occurred millions of years in the past.

## The Time of Storms and Floods
In the beginning, the folly of Arathazyr destroyed the Second Realm and split the Flame Cosmic into the elemental Aratopolai. Like gods, but primitive and unthinking, their presence created the physical world. First it burned, then the land formed from the lakes of fire. Then the roar of air filled the world. Finally, the heavens opened up and it rained.

It rained and rained. For an Age it rained. The World was flooded with water, until only the mountain Arakai was left as solid ground. The waters continued to rise, until Arakai itself was in danger of being swallowed.

Then, without warning, a golden light appeared, perched on the summit of Arakai. Gheida Oru, the Golden Weaver had arrived. From him waves of peace and harmony emerged, and the storms of the Aratopolai were calmed. The storms receded, and there was quiet.

More time passed as Gheida Oru sat there, unmoving. Slowly the waters receded, and Arakai was exposed first, and then the lands beyond. Back and back the waters fell, leaving a great, empty continent.

On the slopes of Arakai the body of Arathazyr lie, and Gheida Oru directed his light towards it. One day, a sapling sprung from the body and grew. Over time it grew into a mighty tree. This was Coreru, the Coros Tree, and from it would come all mortal life.

## The Story of Zed, the All-Father
All mortal life came from Coreru, the Coros Tree. From its fruits sprang forth the Coreruyn, progenitors of mortal species. The Coreruyn mated with each other, and the product of their matings were races of mortal birds, beasts and plants, which spread out and covered Coros. For ages life sprang forth from Coreru.

Eventually, from a fruit that grew on Coreru sprang forth the first humanoid: Zed. Zed was not exactly human as we know it, but was rather a humanoid being from which humanity is derived. Depictions of Zed show a vigorous man with a great wild beard, usually wearing a robe of many colors.

At first Zed wandered the slope of Arakai, and soon he found the Cave of Gheihim.  It was blocked with a great stone.  Zed (who was mighty) moved the stone aside and entered the cave.

Within he found the two surviving Aitheraka: Oruzayr and Garathazayr. Within the cave they had survived the breaking of the Flame Cosmic and the destruction of the Second Realm. Garathazayr had been driven mad, and was now threatening Oruzayr.

In an act of selfless heroism, Zed managed to drive off the far more powerful Garathazayr out of the cave and away. Oruzayr was grateful to Zed and the two became friends. This was the beginning of Oruzayr’s Debt, which would later play out in the life of Arik Therafrae and lead to the creation of the Theracai.

Oruzayr had saved the spirits of many of the Aitheraka within her and now, as Zed watched over her, she gave birth to them in their new form: as dragons. They flew away from Arakai shortly after their birth. Finally, after the last dragon was born, Oruzayr thanked Zed, and departed.

Zed lived on the slope of Arakai, within Gheihim’s Cave, for an age. In that time he may have fathered many species with other Coreruyn that are lost to the ages - possibly a race of giants called the Iimirsoli, or a race of winged humanoids called the Gwaesiryn. What was recorded, however, were the Zedwives.

The Zedwives were five Coreruyn with whom Zed created the humanoid peoples: Amarina, mother of the Marin, Adrene, mother of the Erudyzae, Corina, mother of the Crondar, Valaka, mother of the Druka, and finally, Maridyn, mother of humanity.

Maridyn was called the Mirror-Wife, said to be the most alike in appearance and manner as Zed, and according to human myths, his favorite.  She was the last Zedwife to emerge from Coreru, and as such humans are the youngest of the humanoid peoples.

The first humans were a people called the Oruzeda, and they lived in a land called Aralos, directly south of Arakai. Zed and Maridyn eventually descended from Arakai to live amongst them. There was peace for a time.

However, out in the twilight lands, Garathazayr had been watching the descent of the peoples from Zed, and plotted his revenge. Over time, Garathazayr became known as Gheida Unkh (the Dark Weaver). He became a cautionary tale, something that existed to capture children who wandered too far out into the twilight, away from the light of Gheida Oru.

Gheida Unkh started to whisper to the Oruzeda, planting seeds of fear and doubt into their hearts. Into the minds of the Orduzeda, the Dark Weaver spun the idea that mortality and the necessity of death was a great injustice, and that a cure for death was possible. Somewhere out in the twilight, he whispered a cure for death could be found.

Soon this idea had taken root in many of the Oruzeda, and spread discord and resentment amongst them. The came to Zed and demanded that he help them find the cure for death, which, they were sure, lie out in the twilight. Maridyn tried to counsel against the folly of venturing into the twilight, but the Oruzeda refused to listen.

So regretfully, Zed agreed to lead an expedition of humans out into the twilight to search for this cure, which he suspected did not exist. Maridyn agreed to accompany him, and in a short amount of time he and Maridyn left, leading a large party of Oruzeda with them, venturing out into the twilight, away from Arakai. Those who left Aralos would become known as the Mnabra whereas those who remained would become known as the Manora.


## Lands of Coros

*Coros*, the Third Realm, was all one contiguous reality.  All beings, be they gods, mortals, demons or whatever, all existed somewhere within the one continent of Coros, its waters or the surrounding sea, *Oruluin*. This was far different than its successor, Croftair, where the universe was divided into distinct Domains.

In the center of the continent was the Mountain *Arakai*, where all began.  Originally all lands except the tip of Arakai were covered in water, but the storms retreated from the light of Gheida Oru, who sat atop Arakai, and the waters receded in turn,  exposing the lands.  By the time Coreru, the Coros Tree, started to bear fruit, the great continent had been exposed.

At the base of Arakai, to its east, was the great lake of *Marinos*: the source of the River Erethor, and the home of the Marin.  On the west side of Arakai grew the great Forest *Oruflor*, home of the Erudyzae. To the immediate south of Arakai was *Aralos*, the first human land - a valley nestled between  Lake Marinos and Oruflor.

After the departure of the Mnabra, the remaining humans built a great city within the valley of Aralos, called *Manora*.

To the north of Arakai lie a land of giants, named *Iimirsol*. Beyond Iimirsol was a frozen wasteland of monsters, named *Krothos*.

A mountain range lie to the south of Arakai, not quite has tall as the cosmic mountain, but still mighty.  Named *Corinos*, it was the home of the Crondar. The river Erethor wound south from Lake Marinos cutting a deep and narrow pass through Corinos, called Crofixul.

Beyond Corinos in the south lie the great shadow plains, blocked from the light of Gheida Oru. All lands south of Corinos, save Evalone, were referred to as the Twilight Lands.

First the lands of *Valakh*, home of the Druka, the fierce offspring of the Zedwife Valaka. Valakh directly bordered on Corinos, and the Crondar and Druka frequently were at war.

Then came the far vaster *Sgarelos*.  The spirits of the dead dwelt there, and it was through Sgarelos that the Mnabra wandered, and where Gheida Unkh kidnapped the Mnabra and changed them into the first Ogaratu. The Petagata was located in Sgarelos.

West of Sgarelos was another mountain range, called *Zyrathros*. The Aitheraka offspring of Oruzayr were said to cluster there, although they frequently hunted in Sgarelos.

South and to the east of Sgarelos lie the the land of *Evalone*. It consisted of a circle of mountains called *Aradan*, home of the Macai, surrounding the valleys of *Avalona*, where the Vallonae lived. Evalone was lit by the light of Solrun, who sat atop the mountain Ivrisol, in Aradan.

The Azhrai were also said to have a land called *Gwaesir*, where they lived when they were away from mortals.  The Illai were either to be found in Gwaesir, or atop Arakai when they spoke with Gheida Oru. The location of Gwaesir was a secret, known only to the Azhrai, although it is speculated that it lie west of Oruflor. It is believed that a race of winged humanoids, called the Gwaesiryn, lived there amongst the Azhrai.
