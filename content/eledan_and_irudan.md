# Eledan and Irudan

Eledan and Irudan are two island nations in the Bay of Solrien, west of Solrundria and east of Entreaan. Both are populated by Vallonae descendants who migrated west from Mnabra during the Empire Age.

Eledan, and the three islands extending south of it, is the home of the Woazad people. Fierce and independent, the Woazad are one of the few functional democracies in Croftair. They regularly elect a Wyazan (chief) who governs for three years before standing for re-election. Referendum style votes are taken on a regular basis for major issues. The Woazad maintain a citizen army in which all able-bodied must participate.

The reputation of the Woazad is that they are quiet and civilized under normal conditions, but may turn into berserkers when provoked. Through this reputation, Eledan has maintained its independence throughout the Coronese, Solrundrian and Celestial empires.

The Iruzad people of Irudan are related to the Woazad, but culturally are also closer to the sun tribes of Solrundria.  They managed to avoid the Coronese, but came under the Solrundrian empire (and by extension the Celestial empire).

The Iruzad people distrust the democracy of the Woazad, and have occasionally warred with them over their history, spawning some famous sea battles in the Bay of Solrien. The Iruzad were traditionally ruled by a king, until they became part of Solrundria and were then ruled by a governor.

Eledan and Irudan are also famous for the whiskies they produce (Eleric and Iruic, respectively.)
