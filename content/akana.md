# Kane's Realm

Kane's Realm, or *Akana*, was created in 2007 during the Battle of Amberion when Argon Sgarethorn released the power of Illiasor into Nalitaq's Dark Pattern. The two powers combined and became something entirely new.

From 2007 until the end of Croftair in 2272, Akana existed as a kind of eighth Domain, a pocket of Croftair, into which a chosen few could enter. However, after Amaya and Akedake reset Cor, it was revealed that Akana was actually an embryonic form of Inviros, the Fifth Realm.

## Inhabitants 

Akana has both residents and visitors.

The visitors, called the *Kanai*, are generally mortals from Ardruin who have somehow developed a special bond with Akana. At first they dream of it, then graduating to waking dreams. Finally, with concentration and practice, some Kanai can physically transport themselves into Akana. When they do, their body becomes a three dimensional portal into Akana. The first person to do this was Kane, the Celestial Emperor. It was also performed by later Kanai, including Aryna.

The residents are usually the dead, who would normally wind up in Corboros. However, those with a strong connection to Akana, either directly as Kanai, or through connection to its predecessors Illasor and the Dark Pattern, can come to reside there after their death. Notable residents of Akana are Nalitaq, Sgarethorn, Oruzayr, and Morgatu. Kane himself was a visitor who never left. When he left Akana to assist Aryna's assault on Amberion, his connection was severed. He did not join Akana as a resident.

## Physical Nature

Akana lies somewhere between Ardruin and Aeros in its physical nature. It seems largely physical, like Ardruin, but there is a dreamlike quality to everything, and its physicality can be manipulated by those who are well attuned to it and powerful.

The varying degrees of control over Akana are not always what is expected. Nalitaq had absolute control over the Dark Pattern, but his control over Akana is fairly weak. The presence of Illiasor negated much of his power.

The greatest mastery over Akana that has been demonstrated is by Aryna Daikanai. She can manipulate its geography on a grand scale, and possesses godlike powers within its borders.

Much of Akana seems fixed at any given moment, but in fact is fluid and changing. Time flows at different rates within, and geography changes over time.

There are, however, some fixed elements: the **Pentagata Table**, the **River**, the **Sleeping Plains**, and **Ezima**, a mirror of the Maze of Arkrynn. Many features were reflections of things that existed both in Croftair and in other Realms of Cor.

### The Pentagata Table 

Resembling the Giant's Table of Rondara within Ardruin, surrounded by five doors that clearly reference the Pentagata of Coros, the Pentagata Table is the gathering place for the residents that gradually collect over the course of the Celestial Cycle. Various Kanai, and eventually Aryna, meet the residents here.

Over the course of the Celestial Cycle, the Pentagata Table collects members: first Argon Sgarethorn and Nalitaq Thanakroth, then Kane Invirion, followed by Morgatu and Oruzayr. However, when Kane sacrifices himself to help Aryna, a vacancy is created, and Aryna must become the Fifth.

The Pentagata Table, it turns out, controlled Akana, and guided it into becoming Inviros when the Sisters reset Cor.
