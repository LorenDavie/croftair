# Korathoru
The folly of the Morolai led to the opening of the Pentagata. The Army of Unakroth entered Coros, and at its head was Krothrol, the Devil.  A dark lord of immense raw power, he had been shaped by the Void to crush all in his way.

Ardanor and Solrun forgot their quarrel and initially tried to defend Coros from Krothorl, but quickly found they were overmatched and fell back.  Leaving a path of destruction, the Army of Unakroth cut its way across Sgarelos, in a march towards Evalone.

## The Battle of Evalone
Ardanor and Solrun retreated to Evalone and sounded the alarm.  An array of gods and heroes the world has never seen again assembled to meet the threat of Krothorl: the four Morolai, their Demalai offspring, as well as the heroes of Evalone, including Arik Therafrae and Oruzayr herself. Joining them were legions of fierce Macai warriors.

It was not enough. The Army of Unakroth reached Evalone, and there was a terrible battle beyond imagining.  The gods brought the full force of their fury to bear upon Krothorl, but the dark lord was mightier still.  That day Arik Therafrae died defending Evalone, and Oruzayr’s physical form was destroyed, leaving her bodiless and diffuse. The Morolai held the dark army long enough to evacuate the mortals, but soon Evalone was overrun and destroyed.

## The Battle of Oruflor
The people of Evalone retreated back towards the old lands and, at the borders of Oruflor, beseeched the Erudyzae to fight with them.  They were also met by the Crondar, who sensed the common threat as well.

When Krothorl came for Oruflor, they were met by the alliance of the three peoples. The battle was terrible, and the free peoples suffered terrible losses, but they held the line.  Finally Krothorl’s forces retreated.

During the battle, Umbora observed certain mannerisms of Krothorl, leading her to suspect the truth about his origin.

## The Battle of Arakai
The Army of Unakroth camped at the base of Mount Arakai, where they planned to regroup before launching a second assault on Oruflor.  But the Morolai had different plans.

Umbora snuck into the camp and confronted Krothorl.  She told the dark lord that she saw a scared little boy within him.  Enraged, Krothorl chased Umbora out of the camp, and up the slopes of Mount Arakai.

With Krothorl gone from the encampment, the Morolai launched their assault upon the dark army.  The Macai and Vallonae from Evalone, the Erudyzae and the Crondar, were then joined by the Druka, who had come to fight besides them at last.

Meanwhile, Krothrol found the place where Coreru grew, and under the tree Gheida Oru waited for him. Speaking calmly to him, Gheida Oru awoke the memories within Krothorl: he was in fact Arcun, the son of Zed, who had fallen through the Pentagata ages before, as the Mnabra had wandered in Sgarelos.  Twisted by Unakroth, he had been sent back to destroy the universe.

But Krothorl was too far damaged by Unakroth. In a roar of hatred, he struck out at the Golden Weaver.  Gheida Oru disappeared, but Krothorl struck and destroyed Coreru.

Then, in place of Gheida Oru, Mynok, the Essence of Justice, appeared.  In his hand was Illiasor, and he met Krothorl in battle.  At last, Krothorl met his match.

As the battle raged between the armies at the base of Arakai, Mynok and Krothorl fought on its slopes.  Finally Mynock plunged Illiasor through Krothorl’s chest, killing him.

Krothorl’s spirit was freed from his body and tried to escape, but Umbora was waiting for him.  She caught his spirit in her web, and consumed him, annihilating him.

The battle had done the damage to Arakai, however.  The Cosmic Mountain crumbled, and the universe started to fall apart.  Hernessa swept in and grabbed as many of the peoples as she could, and placed them within the Nessarkha where they could sleep until the universe was repaired.

Arkrynn then performed his greatest miracle.  As the shards of Coros flew apart, he collected them and carefully balanced them against each other, putting them into a perfect equilibrium.  With different concerns carefully separated and balanced against each other, he made a new Realm from the shards of Coros.  This was Divided Realm: Croftair.
