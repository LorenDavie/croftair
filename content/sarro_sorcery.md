# Orders of Sarro Sorcery
The city of Sarro, across the bay from Cadro, was the traditional home of Kyrosian sorcery. Developed over time as knowledge stolen from their Coronese masters, the Kyrosian sorcerers developed several different Mystical Orders. Mizradia and Zaraphon both studied at Sarro in their youth.

### Jhevai
The largest and most powerful order is the Jhevai. Known by their red robes and somber chants, the Jhevai are found everywhere in Sarro. They became popular about 1950, supplanting the older Cyplus order. Zaraphon was a Jhevai, until he witnessed a Jhevai magus defeated in a duel with the Aeranar Vargos Zorn. Jhevai, though powerful, is sometimes criticized for being slow and ponderous.

### Cyplus
A much older order, somewhat supplanted by the rise of Jhevai. Also complex and arcane, if anything more complicated than Jhevai. Cyplus mages wear black and gold.

### Cyx 
The oldest order, begun in secret when the land was Cadria and the Coronese still reigned. Cyx is hard and somewhat primitive, but can be incredibly powerful. Cyx mages do not wear robes in public: their tradition is that their order is secret. In private, their robes are pure black.

### Phaenix
This order was founded on the principles of no forms, no rituals, no long chants, just a pragmatic approach to getting tasks done with magic. Considered by other orders to be ugly and dangerous, Phaenix magic is extremely effective in the right circumstances. Phaenix mages wear grey.

### Rheadra
The youngest of the orders, Rheadra was formed by a number of Jhevai mages who were frustrated with the bureaucracy of the order and decided to make something faster and more dynamic. Drawing on Jhevai, but simplifying it and incorporating elements of Phaenix and Cyx, Rheadra is a powerful, compelling, if somewhat immature order. Rheadra mages wear purple. Mizradia studied at Rheadra.
