# Zed and the Zedwives
All humanoid creatures in Croftair are descended from Zed.  It his from him that they have his humanoid shape.  He is the All-Father, and he lived his life in Coros, the Third Realm.

Zed sprung forth from the fruit of Coreru, the Coros tree which grew from the slain body of Arathazyr, as he lay on the slope of Mount Arakai.  Coreru grew there in the early days of Coros, when the world was flooded with the waters of Madune, and only Arakai existed as dry land.  It rained day and night, and Coreru grew into a mighty tree.

From the fruit of Coreru sprung forth all the beasts and birds of the world.  Eventually Zed came forth. A new being in the world, he wandered Mount Arakai, eventually finding the cave in which Gheihim once dwelt.  There he found Oruzayr and Garathazayr, the sole survivors of Arathazyr's Folly, the cataclysm that destroyed the Second Realm, Aithera.

Garathazayr had been driven mad, and threatened Oruzayr.  In an act of selfless heroism, Zed drove off Garathazayr into the night, thus saving Oruzayr.  This was the beginning of the friendship between man and dragon, Oruzayr's Debt, which would play out in the lives of Arik Therafrae of the Macai, and later the Theracai (Dragon Glass), the center of Coronese power. Garathazayr, driven into the night, would become Gheida Unkh (the Dark Weaver) and would be a bane on the existence of Zed's descendants forever more.

Zed spent a long time with Oruzayr.  At first she gave birth to Arathazyr's children, the Aitheraka (dragons).  Later Zed may have lain with her, but if there were offspring of such a union, they are lost to the ages.

One day, Zed noticed a new being had sprung forth from Coreru.  A shimmering column of water that spoke to him and seduced him.  This was *Amarina*, the first Zedwife, and the mother of the Marin.  Amarina lay with Zed, and then gave birth to the Marin in the great river Erathor, which they made their home.  Sadly no Marin survived Korathoru, the destruction of Coros.  The children of Amarina are lost.

The second Coreruwyn being to catch Zed's eye was *Adrene*, a flowery dryad.  Their union spawned the Erudyzae, the forest people, who dwelt in the great forest Oruflora, on the base of Arakai.

Next came *Corina*, a stout and hearty woman of earth and stone, who mothered the Crondar, the mountain people.  They burrowed into Mount Arakai and its foothills, creating a kingdom within.

Following Corina emerged a shadowy woman who clung to the darkness, never to be fully seen in the light of day.  This was *Valaka*, and her secret union with Zed led to the birth of the Druka, the night people.

Finally, the last of the Zedwives emerged: *Maridyn* is said to be the mirror-wife, the most like Zed in appearance and thought.  Maridyn was Zed's favorite, and with her he fathered the Oruzeda, the primal human race from which all the human peoples of Croftair are descended.  Maridyn accompanied Zed when he left Arakai with the Mnabra, and eventually came with him to Evalone.  After thousands of years, Zed and Maridyn died in Evalone and were buried together.
