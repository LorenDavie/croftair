# Nations of Culwais

![Culwais](images/culwais.png){: class="img-fluid" }

Culwais, the south continent, was largely uninhabited by humanoid life at the dawn of the Empire Age. None of the Elder Age civilizations extended into it. It is possible that the Ogaratu occupied it during the Dark Age, there is at least evidence of them on Xotcitla, off of the west coast of Culwais.

Culwais was first settled by Vallonae during the first wave following the Opening of the Mnabrarkh, and then later conquered by the Empire of Mnabra. Mnabra established cities along the north and east coasts. These colonies became free in the latter years of the Empire, when abandoned by the Ogaratu Masters.

Finally, the Coronese, led by Adric the Conqueror, took the former Mnabran lands, building two cities on Culwais: Tisakhmir and Corvanda.  These lands freed themselves in the post Coronese Civil War period.

## Adraria
The northern most nation of Culwais, and originally called /Solis/, Adraria is populated by the Solisyn people, descendants of Empire Age Vallonae. Solisyn are divided into a caste system, from highest to lowest: Adra (theocrats), Ahmen, Mahta, Ghamen and Uhta. Originally the Solisyn worshipped the Solar pantheon, until the nation was converted by Kazi to Adrarianism in 1805. At that point the ruling Adra caste became the Theocrats and ruled until they were largely wiped out by Zaraphon and Mizradia in the Night of Terror. Mizradia ruled Adraria between the Second and Third Games of the Arcanai. After temporarily falling into the hands of the Therakyn, Adraria was taken over by the Kazien, who ruled throughout the Fourth and Fifth Games. The capital city of Adraria is Tisakhmir.

## Telentranar
Again part of the Empire of Mnabra, Telentranar is a rich source of various natural resources, which are sold through its capital, Corvanda. The Telenti people are Vallonae descendants, and are largely agrarian, although much of Telentranar remains jungle as well.

The river Andoren winds up into the jungle, where somewhere there is reputed to be a lost city of gold (possibly Ogaratu), called Geugolth. Many have ventured, but few have returned. Additionally a tribe that is a splinter from the Telenti lives up the Andoren: the Anadara. The Anadara are suspicious of outsiders, but will sometimes trade for superior weapons.

## Sirania 
A desert land, populated by nomads called the Irinnu. At its heart is a small oasis town called Haevir, but it is divided by large, unpopulated desert expanses. The Irinnu maintain fleets of camels with which they cross the desert at will.

Kazi was an Irinnu born in Sirania in 1774. In the desert the god Adrar spoke to him, making him his prophet. Kazi spread the word of Adrar throughout Culwais, until his assassination in 1808.

Following the Third Game, a radical group called the Kazien rose in Sirania and expanded outwards and north. 

## Mongowanda
There is no central government in Mongowanda, instead it is dominated by three major tribes, all of which descend from Empire Age Vallonae. Mongowanda is covered in heavy jungle.

The Ogana are the largest tribe, and have many villages. Hunters and fishers, they have the most contact with the Telenti and Irinnu, and there is limited trade with the other nations.

The Urexa are a xenophobic, warlike tribe. They avoid outsiders and only interact with the Ogana when they send raiding parties to their villages.

The Mwana are the most remote, living on the far southwestern reaches of Mongowanda and venturing into Xyxazuul. The Mwana people seem to worship the Sisters, and dream of a time when the Ogaratu return to rule once again.

## Xyxazuul
The southwestern peninsula, Xyxazuul is not known to have human inhabitants. It is believed to have been home to a Dark Age Ogaratu empire, along with the island of Xotcitla. Dotted with pyramids and catacombs, Xyxazuul is said to contain monsters and madness. Adventures sometimes venture there in search of Dark Age treasures, but few return.
