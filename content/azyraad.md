# The Azyraad
The Azyraad were created by the Gheihimin during the earliest part of the First Realm, Ora. As the Gheihimin expanded the universe, the put the Azyraad in place to stabilize it. The Azyraad act as bones for the universe, giving it structure and preventing it from being crushed by Unakroth.

In Ora, the Azyraad were said to be like tree trunks that stretched into the sky, bracing the edges of the world. They (along with Mount Arakai) were among the few immutable things in the universe, with all else subject to change by the will of the Gheihimin.

In Aithera, the Azyraad were mentioned as spokes along the great wheel that comprised the Second Realm. The concentric Rings of the Aitheraka were segmented by the Azyraad vectors. The Azyraad were said to provide transportation to the Aitheraka from one Ring to the Next. This was the first time they were used for such a purpose.

In the Old World of Coros, the Azyraad formed a globe around the world. The only break was at the point of the Pentagata, where there was a passage out of the universe into the Void.

When Arakai was destroyed and Arkrynn created Croftair from the shards of Coros, he weaved the Azyraad into the Domains. Within Ardruin, the Azyraad appear as great metal roads that span the continents.

## Properties of the Azyraad 
The Azyraad are highly magical and are resistant to any physical force or magical manipulation. Magically “reflective”, they’ll turn back any spell cast upon them, sometimes amplifying the results, but always acting unpredictably.

Research started in the Coronese Middle Foundation period and brought to fruition by Nalitaq in the Imperial period enabled the Coronese to accelerate motion along the Azyraad. By casting the right spell while walking on the Azyraad, the lands would pass at as much as ten times regular walking speed. The traveler would not experience fast motion, but the lands would blur and change around them. This acceleration also could be harnessed by dragons flying above the Azyraad.

After the Coronese Civil War, Nalitaq took control of the Azyraad. Anyone who walked upon them could be sensed by the Unkhala, would come and attack. The secret to safely traversing the Azyraad became the sole possession of the Talisor (Road Traders), who would guide travelers for a price.

At times, the Azyraad have been made to be a gateway from Ardruin to Azyros. Living beings in Ardruin appear tethered back to their point of entry in Azyros by a silver thread. It is also thought that lost spirits in Azyros sometimes stumble through the Azyraad to Ardruin and become trapped there as ghosts.

During the Third Game of the Arcanai, the dragons Aryazayr and Curinathazayr managed to push an army of enthralled Talisor through the Azyraad into Ardruin, just outside of Corvanda.
