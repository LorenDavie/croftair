# How Does Magic in Croftair Work?

There are several different sets of phenomena generally referred to as *magic*. Each operates by different mechanisms.

The ultimate nature of reality in Cor are patterns of magical energy. These patterns can be manipulated. Ultimately, this manipulation is the essence of magic.

## God Magic

The original manipulator was Gheihim. He was the essence of creativity, and could create anything he could imagine. All of the Gheihimin, including the Azhrai, have some fraction of Gheihim's power. This may be thought of as the power of the gods, but also as the root of magic.

When Gheihim's life force was released as a fire that burned the universe, the Aitheraka inherited this creative power. Like gods, but to a lesser extent, they can manipulate reality. The terrifying "land waves" that the dragons are known for, when land flows like water, is an example of this power.

The Coronese word for magic is *azyr*. It is also the Coronese word for fire, indicating its origins.

## Coronese Sorcery 

Coronese Sorcery, or *Ikoniaka*, is an emulation of draconic power. It is based on the elements of power illustrated by the Tarazyr, and then transferred to the Zairn scrolls. The original Tarazyr outlines 256 sounds and accompanying visualizations, which represent at least one system of draconic magic. Only ten Zairn scrolls survived to be captured by Zairn, so Ikoniaka is based on only 160 symbols. Of those, only 96 are possible by humans, and of them over half are extremely difficult. So most Coronese sorcery is based on combinations of about 40 symbols.

The sounds and visualizations form words and phrases (the spoken form called *Borica*, or High Coronese) that, when spoken around cause the world to change down at the magical pattern level, often with cascading effects in the physical world.

Compared to the other domains, the physical world of Ardruin is extremely resistant to magical manipulation. So spells that reform reality, changing one thing into another, are rare. Instead magic tends to manipulate energy, mental states, or other magic. The kind of wholesale reordering of reality like the land waves of the Aitheraka is far beyond the power of human sorcerers.

Casting magic creates an accompanying negative feedback, called *drain*. In small amounts drain will make a magician tired or sick. In larger amounts it can be fatal and, in very large amounts, can deplete physical objects of enough magical energy that they collapse into flux.

For this reason, sorcerers have sought external power sources for their magic. The greatest of these is undoubtedly the Theracai, or Dragon Glass. Oruzayr, the Primal Dragon, bound in her inert, crystalline form, and controlled by the Dionara. Through the Dionara, the sorcerers of Coron drew power from the Theracai to power their magic. Nalitaq attempted to effectively create an artificial Theracai to power his Dark Pattern.

## Weave

The Weavers of Ulmuria harness what is effectively an antimagic. *Weave* is opposite and equal to Ikoniaka. The two magics perfectly counter and isolate each other, they cannot mix.

The full nature of Weave is unexplored in the west, but is known to be able to manipulate reality in ways similar to Ikoniaka. One additional power, which Ikoniaka doesn't have, is the manipulation of time. The Chainwalkers of Ulmuria can use Weave to speed up and slow down relative time as they direct. A Chainwalker can thus become impossibly fast to those around him, or can become statue-like and immutable.

## Integrated Magic

The Arcanai Zaraphon spent time in Ulmuria, learning its ways. When he returned he found a way to combine Ikoniaka and Weave, forming complicated circuits. He also created the *Bard Engine*, a method of using Integrated Magic to trap and repurpose the natural magical energies of the universe, to power magic.

These two inventions led to far more sophisticated magic becoming available to a much wider range of people. Between 2080 and 2144 (the Second and Third Games of the Arcanai), Integrated Magic spread through the west, causing a revolution of modernization.

## Ogaratu Magic

The Ogaratu have a secret and ancient system of magic that dates back to Azul Thal and beyond. Byzantine and incomprehensible to outsiders, it is limited in scope, but can be very powerful. Of the non-Ogaratu, only Nalitaq is said to have gained any knowledge of the Ogaratu system.

It is believed that the ritual that Zairn used to bind Oruzayr as the Theracai may have been, at least in part, an Ogaratu ritual. It was performed right above Azul Thal and, by Nalitaq's estimate, should have been impossible for Zairn using Ikoniaka. But advanced binding is a specialty of Ogaratu sorcerers, and Azul Thal may be used as a kind of binding circle.

## Folk Magic

Before the rise of Ikoniaka and Integrated Magic, people used to practice Folk Magic. Primarily consisting of controlling spirits that lingered in, or had wandered into Ardruin, Folk Magic mostly created limited, modest results, such as simple healing spells, love potions and tricks with fire.

There is a dark side of Folk Magic, dealing with the manipulation of unsavory animals such as bats, snakes and spiders. Calgirna of the Arcanai is a master of this, particularly in the mass manipulation of Jezkraal death snakes to reanimate corpses, making zombies.

## Religious Magic

The higher powers are mostly prevented from manipulating Ardruin by the law of Krynna. However they can intervene to a limited extent, mostly by channeling power through their worshippers.

This comes in the form of prayers answered by power via the devout. For example, priests of Ardanor can make requests about the weather, which are answered frequently enough that people employ them to ensure good weather for special occasions, provide rain for crops etc.

There is generally no religious equivalent of the complex cognitive model required by Ikoniaka and Integrated Magic. Religious magic can't be designed or even controlled with a high degree of accuracy. It's a request made to a god, who sends power through the devout to do something along the lines of what was requested.

The other form of religious magic is the use of the devout to channel god-energy that is *not* the result of a request. This is when the god is enacting their own agenda, and using their worshippers as pawns. The religious speak of being *compelled*, which is usually an indication that their god is sending power through them. This is extremely popular with the Kazien. Adrar sends compellations through them all the time, moving them like chess pieces.
