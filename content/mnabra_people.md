# The Mnabra
Regretfully, Zed and Maridyn led the group of Oruzeda who insisted upon searching for a cure for death out of Aralos and into the Twilight Lands. Coros was vast, and so traveling from one land to another took years and years.  Centuries passed.

## Wandering in Sgarelos
The wanderers became known as the Mnabra (the Wandering People), and they initially followed the River Erethor down, through Crofixul, and into Valakh, the land of the Druka people. There they were set upon and suffered great losses.  Only when the Druka recognized Zed as the All-Father were the Mnabra allowed to escape.  But they were driven away from Erethor, and became lost in the lands of Sgarelos.

On the far reaches of the Corinos mountain range, the light of Gheida Oru could no longer be seen. Through the darkness, only hints of indirect light from beyond Corinos lit the way of the Mnabra.  Zed and Maridyn performed miracles to feed and water their people, and generations passed. Farther and farther from the memory of Arakai the Mnabra grew, and no future beyond endless wandering in darkness seemed possible.

During this time, the Mnabra started to be stalked by Garathazayr, now known as Gheida Unkh. The old dragon remembered Zed’s insult back at the beginning at Arakai, and was determined to take revenge.  Slowly, Gheida Unkh started to kidnap the Mnabra.

Stealing away with them, Gheida Unkh altered them through dark magic, making a subspecies. These were the first Ogaratu, and they were thralls of the Dark Weaver. Slowly Gheida Unkh built a hoard of Ogaratu in the darkness. Still he was unable to take them all, because of Zed and Maridyn’s protection. The power of Coreru burned within them, and Gheida Unkh, diminished from his time in Coros, lacked the power to confront them directly.

Instead, the Dark Weaver cast illusions, making the Mnabra think they could hear the river Erethor. Following the sound, they found no sign of the river, but instead were led to the place of the Petagata.

## The Pentagata and the Return of the Azhrai
Through Gheida Unkh’s design, the Mnabra found themselves at the place of the Pentagata. A great gateway, seemingly to nowhere, standing alone in the wastes of Sgarelos. Its origin was unknown. It was known that it was not the creation of Gheida Unkh. The Ogaratu believe it was the creation of the Sisters: Amaya and Akedeke.

Zed was cautious of the Pentagata, and forbade the Mnabra from approaching. They camped nearby, to spend the night before moving on. During the night, Gheida Unkh spoke to Zed’s son, named Arcun, through his dreams. Behind the gateway of the Pentagata, he whispered, was the salvation of the Mnabra, and all that Arcun could desire.

Overcome with desire, Arcun stole away in the night to the place of the Pentagata. With a trembling hand, he opened the gate.

Horrors flew into the world. The gate was out of the universe, and into the void Unakroth. Madness and monsters entered in, escaping into Sgarelos. Finally, to close the gate, Arcun hurled himself against it, but instead fell out of the universe and into the void. All seemed lost.

But then, the Azhrai, still held within the armor of Orunai, spotted the open gate from the void and reentered Cor, finally closing the gate.

Sgarelos was filled with monsters, and the Mnabra seemed doomed, but the Azhrai revealed themselves to the Mnabra, and led them to a land where they would be finally safe: Evalone.
