# Aithera: The Second Realm
Aithera is the Second Realm of Cor. Timelines into previous realms are tenuous, however in linear terms the events that occurred within Aithera can be thought of as having happened hundreds of millions of years before Croftair. Aithera is the origin of the Aitheraka, who are known by mortals as dragons.

Aithera is also the name of the Cosmic Fire, that was released by the body of Gheihim when it was transformed by Arkrynn.  The Fire Aithera washed over the universe, destroying the First Realm.

For ages there was nothing but the Fire Cosmic.  It burned and burned, until finally, it started to self-organize into conscious entities.  The Fire formed seven planes of reality, known as the Rings of Aithera.  Within each Ring, an order of the Aitheraka slowly came into existence.

Within the First Ring formed the two Cosmic Dragons: Oruzayr and Arathazyr. Like yin and yang, they represented the duality of nature in the universe, and were the first to achieve self-awareness. All of space and time were visible at once to the Cosmics.

The Second Ring held the Royals, of which there were four: Garathazayr, Marazayr, Perinathazayr and Sarazayr.   The Royals could see all of space, but, unlike the cosmics, time was dark for them.

The Third Ring was the Nobles, and there were sixteen of them. Known Nobles include Gorgorathazayr (sometimes called the Great Old One) and Trarathazayr.  The Nobles did not have the Far Sight of the Cosmics and Royals, but could sense fate, and knew the Correct Path of the Universe.

The Fourth Ring was the Guardians, of which there are 256. Known Guardians are Dreyathazayr, Aryazayr and Curinathazayr. The Guardians could sense danger to the Aitheraka.

The Fifth Ring was the Rangers, numbering 65,536. The Sixth Ring was the Harvesters, numbering over 4 billion, and the Seventh Ring was the Ether, with numbers uncountable.

## The Nature of Aithera
Aithera, if anything, was even less physical than Ora. The mountain Arakai and the Azyraad remained, but concepts of location, solidity and normal flow of time all seemed to not quite apply to Aithera, or at least follow a completely alien set of rules. For this reason there are few stories of the ages that passed in the second realm, simply because mortals have few points of context to help them understand what occurred.

In the later realms, the surviving Aitheraka would often complain of a terrible “wetness” to reality, indicating that something about the later fabric of reality itself was uncomfortable to them. They much preferred the way the universe was in the Second Realm. It is likely that mortal life could not possibly live there, however it was. In Croftair, the domain Azyros is said to be closest to Aithera, but even there is is uncomfortable to the dragons.

The final clue is that the fundamental elements that made up physical reality from the Third Realm onwards are derived from the singular Aithera energy. Aithera represented all of those elements in a fusion state: formed into a single phenomenon. This is impossible for mortals to imagine, but it seems that physical reality is a “broken” version of the reality that the Aitheraka knew before.

## Ignian Arathazyr: The Folly of Arathazyr
While the events that occurred during the life of the Second Realm are lost to the ages, we have some idea how it ended. It began with the corruption of the Royal, Garathazayr.

Like Morakal before him, Garathazayr was called to the edges of the universe. There, in a voice so subtle that he may not have known it to actually be a voice, Garathazayr was corrupted by the Void Unakroth. To Morakal it had spoken a tale of fear, to Garathazayr it spoke a tale of greed.

Garathazayr grew to desire power. He wanted to become great - greater than the other Royals, greater than the Cosmics even. He wanted to become the greatest of the Aitheraka, and rule over Aithera.

Garathazayr was cunning, and he decided to trick the Cosmic Arathazyr, using the same greed as bait. He went to Arathazyr and convinced him that he could absorb the power of the Azyraad, and thus of the Gheihimin before them. Garathazayr knew this would destroy Arathazyr, and he had a plan to absorb Arathazyr’s power. From there he would slay Oruzayr, and then become the supreme Aitheraka.

At Garathazayr’s urging, and against the advice of Oruzayr, Arathazyr cast a great enchantment to absorb the power of the Azyraad.  It was a gross miscalculation.

The Azyraad remained, but there was an immense magical backlash that slew Arathazyr instantly. But instead of stopping there, it washed over Aithera, breaking the Cosmic Fire, causing it to decay into lesser elements.

Most of the Aitheraka were killed, except for Oruzayr and Garathazayr who took shelter in the Cave of Gheihim. Magically, Oruzayr managed to reach out and collect some of the essences of the Aitheraka, and held them within her where they survived.

In an instant, the Cosmic Fire was snuffed out. It decayed down into physical reality.  The Aratopolai (elements) were born, and a great storm raged over the universe. Air, and earth, and fire, and then much, much water covered all. Aithera, the Second Realm, had ended, and the Third Realm, Coros, had begun.
