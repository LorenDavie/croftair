# Secret History of the Dark Age
The Dark Age of Croftair is a 50,000 year period between the opening of Azul Thal, and the opening of the Erudarkh. It is a time dominated by the Ogaratu. The history of this time is unknown outside of Ogaratu scholarly circles, as they do not speak of it to outsiders. However, woven into this time was the doom of Croftair.

## Azul Thal 
The Ogaratu had lived within Azul Thal, for ages. Multiple civilizations had already risen and fallen within the Hanging City. The Ogaratu had a knack for constantly returning to Dark magic, summoning horrors, and suffering the consequences. A few would survive the catastrophe, swear never to repeat their folly, and rebuild. Within a few thousand years they would be back to their old habits. It was a cycle said to have repeated at least 100 times over millennia.

This time was going to be different. The Ogaratu magicians were drawing power from Unakroth in a rawer form than ever before. Pure chaos, it mutated horribly anything it touched. Of course it got out of control and started to work it’s way through the population.

The Ogaratu could not stop the evil and started to realize that this time, they were truly done for. The Red Horror, it was called, and it was set to wipe the Ogaratu out once and for all.

A small group found a record of two goddesses who had visited them back in the Old World, when they were recently abandoned thralls of Gheida Unkh, wandering in Sgarelos. The Sisters, Amaya and Akadake, were the only ones to ever show them kindness. They preyed to them now.

The Sisters answered, and broke the great seal at the entrance to Azul Thal. Placed there by Hernessa herself, it was a demonstration of the power of the Sisters, greater even then the Illai. The Ogaratu converted in mass, and escaped the Red Horror, spilling into primeval Ardruin, roughly 100,000 BE.

## Early Times in Ardruin
Ardruin in those days was not entirely stable. It was going through a similar process that the Old World Coros had undergone during the Time of the Aratopolai. Volcanoes erupted, strange monsters roamed the land.  For 5000 years the Ogaratu scattered into different tribes, hiding in caves and hunting and gathering for food. All this time they kept the faith of the Sisters with them, and were said to be rewarded with insights.

## The Coming of the Faceless Ones
Around 95,000 BE records speak of the arrival of god like creatures called the Faceless Ones who established a presence in northern Caros. Enslaving the Ogaratu, they built an empire of death and destruction. The dead were said to rise as their army. For 3000 years the Faceless Ones ruled without mercy.

The records speak of an Ogaratu hero named Makh, who unleashed a magic that burned the Faceless Ones, destroying them. The burning magic then got out of control in its own, and raged across the land, decimating the Ogaratu population.

The burning magic was eventually halted by sorcerers known as the Water Wizards. This began their rise to power.

## The Age of Sea Power
Across Ardruin the Water Wizards travelled, driving back the Burning Magic, and therefore welcomed by the other Ogaratu they met. Thus they met almost no resistance as they effectively conquered the known world.

It is believed the Water Wizards somehow drew power from the Azyraad while on the seas. The known paths of the Azyraad are mostly on land, but it is possible that more paths lie underwater. The ships of the Water Wizards crossed the seas in times unimaginable in later ages. During this time the Ogaratu explored Ardruin, even reaching Ulmuria.

For almost 8000 years the Water Wizards dominated the world, and then they disappeared virtually over night.

It is unknown what happened, exactly, but it is thought that they released some horror from the bottom of the sea. An abomination the size of a small continent, and spewing clouds of foul creatures and toxic, magic waste, this evil hurricane of death wandered the seas and, within a few weeks, the Water Wizards were destroyed. It is thought that approximately 85% of the Ogaratu were wiped out around the year 84,000 BE.

Some say that this was the revenge of the Marin, payback for the destruction of their race at the hands of the Ogaratu.

## The New Thal Empire
Around 80,000 BE, leaders of the tribes of Ogaratu, slowly repopulating from their apocalypse, came together to meet at what is now Caestia (at that time joined to Culwais as a single continent). They elected a leader and formed what scholars call the New Thal Empire.

At first, with power balanced between the chieftains, the Empire served the needs of all. But after a few hundred years, a chieftain backed by one faction seized power and became the Thal Emperor. Forcing the other chieftains to bend the knee or die, the new Thal Empire spread out from its center on Culwais to conquer much of the known world again, bringing the other Ogaratu nations to heel.

Stability did not last, however. Regions broke into rebellion, and the Empire was torn into three parts, centered on the continents of Caros, Ulmuria and the Culwais-Caestia supercontinent. Never again would there be a unified Ogaratu empire. The new, three sided empire was called the Trion.

## The Trion
The Trion consisted of the Morokho Empire in Caros, the Unxaarae in the south and Eascerpae in Ulmuria. Almost immediately the three empires were at war.

The ancient magic of the Water Wizards was resurrected and sea battles raged. Saerluin was said to have ran red with blood for years because of the endless, brutal war.

Eventually the sorcerers of Eascerpae cast a great enchantment, rendering Crofluin impassible. All sea traffic between Ulmuria and the West was halted.

It is believed that it was the Unxaarae finally responsible for the downfall of the Ogaratu. Channeling power directly from Thorla, and somehow bypassing the Law of Krynna, the Unxaarae sorcerers summoned Ghuruzaal, the Lord of Disaster.

Ghuruzaal’s presence in Ardruin was immediately accompanied by a massive explosion that created the Bay of Telen and sunk Ogarataere, splitting Culwais and Caestia into separate continents. Waves of death preceded the monster, and the Ogaratu were largely wiped out, again.

By all rights Ghuruzaal should have destroyed Ardruin, but vanished shortly thereafter. It is thought the Azhrai probably intervened, but the Ogaratu were in such disarray that they did not record the events.

By 75,000 BE the Dark Age civilizations of the Ogaratu were largely destroyed. A few cities around the edges of the world survived, but anything near the center was completely destroyed. The world remained largely unpopulated by humanoid life beyond a few Ogaratu survivors, until the opening of the Erudarkh and the coming of the Erudyzae around 50,000 BE.

## Legacy
A few scattered ruins of Ogaratu Dark Age civilizations remained in the Celestial Era. The most important is Telaza in Ulmuria. It is believed that Telaza was linked to the Faceless Ones, who were agents of Unakroth. Their capacity to raise the dead matches the powers of the Unatar, the agents of destruction at the end of the Celestial Era, the heralds of Kharakh.

Kharakh himself, the Essence of Destruction, is thought to be an Ogaratu discovery, a dark counterpart to Orunai the Guardian. The Ogaratu knew things about the universe that eluded even the wisest of later civilizations. They had been told the dark secrets by the Sisters. The void Unakroth was not empty. Things besides the universe Cor moved in its darkness.
