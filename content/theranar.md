# The Theranar 
The Theranar are the Dragon Lords of Coron. They answer directly to the Dionara, and most significantly control the seven Dragons that form the foundation of Coron’s hard power.

When Edric became the first Dionara, binding himself to the Theracai, the seven Dragons appeared. He commanded that they bind themselves to seven of his most trusted followers.

The bond between Theranar and Dragon is deep and hard to understand for outsiders. A Theranar feels the Dragon on a telepathic and empathic level, but the Dragon’s mind is too alien to be comprehensible for a human, so it changes the Theranar over time. They are not of humanity so much after time, and they care not for its petty issues. Only the Theracai and the Dionara matter.

The Theranar have many powers from their Dragons. They have great strength, are resistant to damage and magic, and can command the power of their Dragons to somewhat shape reality at their will. And of course, the Theranar ride and command their Dragons, bringing god-like power with them. A Dragon can take on a human army, even if that army is supported by magic.

Politically the Theranar are empowered to choose the next Dionara. In practice they almost always choose a clear heir of the previous Dionara, but occasionally there is not a clear heir, and their choice becomes critical. They cannot be intimidated, which is why Edric felt it was safe for them to hold this power.

The Theracai dwell in the mountain fortress of Cai Theran. Reachable only by one treacherous winding road, or through the air on the back of a Dragon. There, the Theranar and their retinue dwell. Periodically the Theranar choose acolytes, who are trained to replace them in the event of their death. The Dragons themselves are immortal, of course.
